I'm a manufacturer.
I'm not a dealer.

Grant me this divorce
and stay out of our lives.

- You're my new lab assistant.
- Gale Boetticher.

00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:13,350
They're assassins. I believe
I was their prime target.

7
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:15,864
They were steered away
from me to my brother in law.

8
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:19,848
- It's tens of thousands of dollars.
- We have the money.

9
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:22,567
- You are not in this.
- How I am not in this?

10
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:26,415
I was wondering how soon you might
be able to take over the lab yourself.

11
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,131
It comes down to
you and me versus him.

12
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:29,890
I'm sorry, but
it's gonna be him.

13
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:31,562
They got me in the laundry
and they're going to kill me.

14
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:32,661
Do it!

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,194
Just what the hell was that?

16
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:36,599
You might wanna hold off.

17
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:37,771
Why?

18
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:39,774
Because your boss
is gonna need me.

00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:33,182
Very, very well.

00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:36,353
It's a flurry of deliveries.

24
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,689
Feels like Christmas morning.

00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:41,892
Ah, it's exciting.

26
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,396
It's really coming together.

27
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:46,098
And I would like to point out

28
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:49,069

very understandable questions

29

Within a month, I'd say.

41
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,100
Two weeks.

42
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:23,808
Uh, yeah, two weeks.

43
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:25,976
Good. Very good.

00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,244
By the way,

45
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:29,814
that sample
you asked me to run,

46
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:34,286
I ran it, and it is quite good.

47
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,788
Thank you very much, Gale.

48
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,323
You can give that
to Victor to discard.

49
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,058
Uh, sure.

50
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,560
Is that our competition?

51
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,928
I'm sorry?

52
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,563
The, uh...

53
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,999
It really is quite good.

54
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,767
The purity, of course,
I'm speaking of,

55
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,203
speaking strictly
in chemical terms.

56
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,172
And I can't, as of yet,
account for the blue color,

57
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:59,245
but, uh... if that
is our competition,

58
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,514
we have our work
cut out for us,

59
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,316
so to speak.

60
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,118
You don't have
any competition, Gale,

61
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,887
not as far as I'm concerned.

62
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:10,123
After all,
how pure can pure be?

63
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:14,495
Well, it can be
pretty darn pure.

64
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:19,200
Mr. Fring,
I can guarantee you

65
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:23,037
a purity of 96%.
I'm proud of that figure.

66
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,473
It's a hard-earned
figure, 96.

67
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:29,211
However, this other
product is 99,

68
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:32,714
maybe even a touch beyond that.

69
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:36,351
I'd need an instrument
called a gas chromatograph

70
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:39,054
to say for sure, but, uh,

71
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:43,492
that last 3%, it may
not sound like a lot,

72
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:45,660
but it is.

73
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:47,796
It's tremendous.

74
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,399
It's a tremendous gulf.

75
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,868
Gale, for our purposes,

76
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:57,439
96% will do just fine.

77
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,576
Please, don't let this
trouble you.

78
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:04,647
Yeah. It's just...

79
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:07,685
I'd love to know
who synthesized it

80
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,153
is all.

81
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:13,958
A man who wants
to work with me.

82
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:16,160
A trained chemist,
like yourself.

83
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:18,796
But it won't happen.

84
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,265
I don't consider him
a professional.

85
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:27,903
If he's not, I don't know
what that makes me.

86
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:30,473
I'm not trying to talk
myself out of a job.

87
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:34,076
With this person,
there are other considerations.

88
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:38,915
His is the best I've
ever seen, hands down.

89
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:44,254
And I look at this
place that you've built,

90
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:46,457
the money you're investing,

91
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:49,127
sparing no expense.

92
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:51,163
And I know--

93
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,236
I know that you want the best.

00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,579
so yeah, Marie, if you and him

334
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,315
and everybody else in America
secretly took a vote

335
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:21,786
and changed the meaning of
the entire English language,

336
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,488
yeah, I guess
I broke new ground.

337
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,660
Well, call it
a figure of speech,

338
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:32,665
but I am seeing progress.

339
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,871
Definite progress.

340
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:41,574
You're ordering a new rock?

341
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,844
I'm bidding on a new mineral.

342
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:48,447
It's a nice one.

343
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,619
What? It's pretty.

344
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:57,188
I need the thing.

345
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,889
Okay.

346
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,824
<i>Numero uno?</i>

347
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:02,292
<i>Dos.</i>

348
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:13,137
Okay.

349
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:39,961
Those--

350
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:43,265
Those pretty little crystals.
I like that.

351
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:46,135
Okay.

352
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:09,217
All right, I just
want to go on record

353
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:11,452
we should all be wearing masks.

354
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:21,595
We should be wearing masks.

355
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:27,535
[muttering]

356
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:29,437
Mmm.

357
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:39,882
I bet he forgets the aluminum.

358
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,822
Guaranteed.

359
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:48,024
Guarantee he forgets.

360
00:27:52,196 --> 00:27:53,496
Uh-huh.

361
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,964
Oh, you don't know

362
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:56,699
what the hell you're
doing, do you?

363
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:58,901
You forgot the aluminum.

364
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:04,740
One of the first steps
in the--

365
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,482
Son of a bitch.

366
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,022
[door opens]

367
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:03,864
All right, let's talk
about Gale Boetticher.

368
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:07,134
He was a good man
and a good chemist,

369
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:08,502
and I cared about him.

370
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:13,774
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

371
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:15,743
He didn't deserve it at all.

372
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:21,115
But I'd shoot him
again tomorrow

373
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:24,419
and the next day
and the day after that.

374
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:27,388
When you make it Gale versus me

375
00:30:27,422 --> 00:30:29,423
or Gale versus Jesse,

376
00:30:29,457 --> 00:30:32,526
Gale loses, simple as that.

377
00:30:37,831 --> 00:30:39,398
This is on you, Gus--

378
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:40,766
Not me, not Jesse.

379
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,068
Gale's death is on you.

380
00:30:45,738 --> 00:30:48,440
I mean, really, what did
you expect me to do,

381
00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:50,509
just simply roll over

382
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:52,778
and allow you to murder us?

383
00:30:52,813 --> 00:30:55,214
That I wouldn't
take measures--

384
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:57,684
Extreme measures
to defend myself?

385
00:30:57,718 --> 00:30:58,752
Wrong!

386
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:01,589
Think again.

387
00:31:01,623 --> 00:31:02,957
And whatever--

388
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,260
Whatever it is
you're planning there,

389
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:07,295
whatever--
Whatever it is--

390
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,930
The point that you're
trying to make here,

391
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:12,135
let me-- Let me suggest that
you keep one thing in mind.

392
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,105
Without us,

393
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,107
without Jesse and myself,

394
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:21,279
you have no one
to make your product.

395
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,416
Certainly not him.

396
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,117
This-- This person
doesn't know

397
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,285
what the hell he's doing!

398
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,487
Been watching him for weeks.

399
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,323
I know every step of his cook.

400
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,026
Oh!

401
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,961
Do you really? You--

402
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,830
[grunt]

403
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:46,170
Really? Oh,
so please tell me.

404
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,006
Catalytic hydrogenation,

405
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,908
is it protic or aprotic?
Because I forget.

406
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,511
And if our reduction
is not stereospecific,

407
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,815
then how can our product
be enantiomerically pure?

408
00:31:56,849 --> 00:32:00,017
I mean,
is 1 phenyl, 1 hyrdoxyl,

409
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,586
2 methylaminopropane--

410
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,555
containing, of course,
chiral centers

411
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,025
at carbons number 1 and 2
on the propane chain?

412
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,427
Then reduction
to methamphetamine

413
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:12,931
eliminates which
chiral center is it again?

414
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,266
Because I forgot.

415
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:18,970
Come on, help me out,
professor!

416
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,205
Gus.

417
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:22,740
We're here. Come on.

418
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:25,010
Let us work.

419
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:29,047
All his bullshit aside,
it's called a cook.

420
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,416
See, everything comes down
to following a recipe.

421
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,085
Simple, complicated,
it doesn't matter.

422
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,521
The steps never change,

423
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:39,624
and I know every step.

424
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,893
Oh, is--
Is that what you want?

425
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:45,697
This-- This...
short order cook?

426
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,232
You're not flipping
hamburgers here, pal.

427
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,435
What happens when you get a
bad barrel of precursor?

428
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,170
Or how would you even know it?

429
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,939
And what happens in the summer

430
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,441
when-- When-- When
the humidity rises

431
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,743
and your product goes cloudy?

432
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,079
H-How would you
guard against that?

433
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,080
Huh?

434
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,215
Gus.

435
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,785
You do this,

436
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,820
all you'll have left

437
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:13,091
is an $8 million
hole in the ground.

438
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,459
This lab--

439
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:17,962
This equipment is
useless without us.

440
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,331
Without-- Without
Jesse and myself,

441
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,466
you have no new product.

442
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,402
You-- You--
You have no income.

443
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,537
Your people out there
will not be paid.

444
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,039
Your distribution chain
collapses.

445
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,007
Without us...

446
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,942
you have nothing.

447
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:38,114
You kill me, you have nothing.

448
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:41,450
You kill Jesse,
you don't have me.

449
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,668
You won't do this.

450
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,471
You're too smart.

451
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,742
You can't afford to do this.

452
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,210
Please.

453
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:11,181
Let us just go back to work.

454
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,683
We're here.

455
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,018
Let us work.
We're-- We're--

456
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:16,920
We're ready to go to work.

457
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,589
We'll just pick up
right where we left off.

458
00:34:21,658 --> 00:34:22,825
[gasp]

459
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:28,197
Ohh!

460
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,813
[under his breath] Oh, my God.

461

[gurgle]

462
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,039
[Gus] Well?

463
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,276
Get back to work.

464
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:46,554
[grunting]

465
00:38:55,396 --> 00:38:58,764
Let's just--
We'll just lay this down.

466
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:01,167
We'll put him in feet first.

467
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:02,935
Grab his shoe.

468
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:05,737
Oh. Here. Wait, wait.
Just life him up.

469
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:07,839
There. All right.

470
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:08,874
Here we go.

471
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:11,176
[grunting]

472
00:39:12,545 --> 00:39:13,846
God.

473
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,915
If you push that way,
I'll hold him in.

474
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:19,685
Okay, ready?

475
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,720
1--
[grunting]

476
00:39:21,755 --> 00:39:23,021
Oh, shit!

477
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:24,656
Ohh!

478
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:26,492
All right, wait. Wait.

479
00:39:26,526 --> 00:39:28,828
[straining]

480
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:30,296
[Walt] Forget that.

481
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,764
[panting]

482
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,467
Ohh.

483
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:35,702
Ohh.

484
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:41,074
Come on.

485
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:42,109
Up!

486
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:44,612
Ohh!

487
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:46,614
[groaning]

488
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:48,216
Get down.

489
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:51,585
Okay.

490
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:09,636
I never used this stuff.
You sure it'll do the job?

491
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,071
Trust us.

492
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:43,830
Here you go, hon.
Get you anything else?

493
00:41:43,864 --> 00:41:45,332
Uh, no, I'm good.
Thanks.

494
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:53,073
God.

495
00:42:14,594 --> 00:42:15,960
How are you doing?

496
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:20,764
No, I mean, you know--

497
00:42:23,234 --> 00:42:24,868
How are you doing?

498
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:34,977
You did the only thing
that you could.

499
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:36,913
I hope you understand that.

500
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:41,717
Thoughts?

00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:46,890
Got any thoughts

502
00:42:46,924 --> 00:42:50,059
on what our next move might be?

503
00:42:50,093 --> 00:42:52,128
What next move?

504
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:53,796
Our next move.

505
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,098
Our next move,

506
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:58,501
given the fact that
at the first opportunity

507
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:00,270
Gus will kill us.

508
00:43:00,304 --> 00:43:03,607
What, that wasn't
an opportunity just now?

509
00:43:03,641 --> 00:43:06,476
Seemed like a pretty damn
good opportunity to me.

510
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,445
No, no.
Golden, I would say.

511
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:10,146
We bought ourselves some time.

512
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:11,781
Uh-uh.
Yes, but--

513
00:43:13,116 --> 00:43:15,184
The question is how much.

514
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,286
He'll be looking
for another chemist.

515
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,421
He's not going to find
another chemist.

516
00:43:19,456 --> 00:43:20,522
Hmm.

517
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,958
Where is he going to find
another chemist?

518
00:43:22,992 --> 00:43:25,227
It's not just about somebody

519
00:43:25,261 --> 00:43:27,362
being able
to run a lab that big.

520
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,130
Someone he can trust,

521
00:43:29,164 --> 00:43:32,334
someone he knows will
keep their mouths shut.

522
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,204
Yeah. Good luck with that.

523
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,476
Bet it took him years
to find Gale.

524
00:43:43,046 --> 00:43:44,613
Bet he's sorry now.

525
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,123
Are you sure you're okay?

526
00:43:55,157 --> 00:43:57,391
At least now we all
understand each other.

527
00:43:57,425 --> 00:43:59,760
Right?

528
00:43:59,794 --> 00:44:00,828
What do you mean?

529
00:44:00,862 --> 00:44:04,664
I mean him and us, we get it.

530
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,875
We're all on the same page.

531
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:20,082
What page is that?

532
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,752
The one that says...

533
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:24,754
if I can't kill you,

534
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:27,657
you'll shit wish you were dead.

535
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:30,392
[chuckling]

536
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,269
Yo. Excuse me.

537
00:44:43,705 --> 00:44:44,872
Thanks.

538
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:48,509
Ahh,

539
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:00,087
Here.

540
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:03,524
Thanks.

541
00:45:04,626 --> 00:45:05,927
[cough]

542
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:14,636
[door closes]

543
00:45:23,213 --> 00:45:24,347
Hi.

544
00:45:27,218 --> 00:45:28,418
Hi.

545
00:45:30,321 --> 00:45:32,790
Um, it's-- It's parked
over on Amsden.

546
00:45:32,824 --> 00:45:34,392
Junior was about to get up,

547
00:45:34,426 --> 00:45:36,160
and he would have seen it,

548
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:38,764
so I wanted to avoid
a lot of questions.

549
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:42,167
That was smart.

550
00:45:42,202 --> 00:45:43,970
Yeah.

551
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:47,473
Kenny Rogers.

552
00:45:50,076 --> 00:45:51,643
Uh...

553
00:45:53,746 --> 00:45:55,213
You okay?

554
00:45:57,115 --> 00:45:58,449
Yeah.

555
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:00,851
Right as rain.

556
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:09,994
Do you have your keys?

557
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:11,529
Yeah.

558
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:14,566
Uh, it's parked
three blocks down

559
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,967
on the right.

560
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:19,705
Yeah.

561
00:47:10,456 --> 00:47:14,000
