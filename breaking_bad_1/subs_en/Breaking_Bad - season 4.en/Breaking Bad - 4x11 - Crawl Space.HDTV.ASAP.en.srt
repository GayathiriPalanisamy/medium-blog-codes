181
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:00,310
From what you've told me,

182
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:02,512
this situation
with Walt's gambling

183
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:06,683
sounds...intense.

184
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:11,288
Yeah, it definitely was

185
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:14,325
and continues to be.

186
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:19,062

greatly appreciate it

187
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:23,401
if you would just
help me out here.

188
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,937
Well, I have thought
long and hard about this,

189
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,140
and, uh...

190
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:31,075
here's what I want to do.

[clears throat]

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,249
So is, uh, Walt gonna be okay?

193
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:40,917
Are you in contact with him?

194
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,918
Um, he's fine.

195
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:45,420
Good. That's good.

196
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:50,024
He doesn't know
about you offering, uh--

197
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,526
No, absolutely not,

198
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,096
and I mean
to keep it that way, so...

199
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:59,868
$617,000

200
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:02,203
written out to me.

201

Uh, what is this?

202
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:09,209
- I can't take your money.
- Oh?

203
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:10,711
And why is that?

204
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:12,713
Because at the end of the day,

205
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:17,151
paying my debt with
illicit gambling winnings...

206
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:20,454
I don't know.
It feels wrong.

207
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:22,456
It feels wrong?

208
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,391
- To me, it does.
- Uh-huh.

209
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:25,893
I'm not judging you or Walt.

210
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:29,396
I'm just saying I feel
uncomfortable with it.

211
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:31,198
Well, um, Ted,

212
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:33,200
the whole reason
we're in this mess

213
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:36,203
is because you had me
cooking your books.

214
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:38,973
So when did wrong

215
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,975
suddenly become
a problem for you?

216
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:43,645
Now, hold on.
That was a one-time measure.

217
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,648
I took an honest attempt
to protect my employees

218
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:48,650
and save my dad's company.

219
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:50,652
And it might've been a mistake,

220
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,920
but that's no reason
to go out and make another.

221
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:56,257
No, Ted. This is
the big mistake right here.

222
00:14:56,291 --> 00:15:01,295
You owe the federal government
$617,000.

223
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,631
If you do not pay them,
they will come after you,

224
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:06,067
and then they will
come after me.

225
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:08,102
And if they audit my business,

226
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:11,338
find out that Walt and I
paid for it

227
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:13,441
with close to a million dollars

228
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,376
in untaxed gambling winnings,

229
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,011
we will go to prison,

230
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:18,879
where you will already be.

231
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,381
Do you understand?

232
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:22,116
I understand you're upset,

233
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,452
but I think you're
overstating things, too.

234
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:25,786
No one's going to prison.

235
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:29,056
Oh, my God. How are you
not following me here?

236
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:31,058
Okay. Fine.

237
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:34,027
Let's say I take your advice.

238
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:36,864
I pay the IRS.
Then what?

239
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:39,399
Then you don't owe them.

240
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:42,602
Okay. But I still
owe the bank, Skyler.

241
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:44,604
I'm still gonna go bankrupt.

242
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:46,606
I'll lose my business
and my home.

243
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,175
I still have to pull
my girls out of school.

244
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,176
Just because I pay
some stupid fine

245
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:54,146
doesn't make my life
any less ruined.

246
00:15:56,283 --> 00:16:01,253
So, if I'm understanding
you correctly,

247
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:05,857
you're saying you can't
take the money I gave you,

248
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:08,659
but you can take
a larger amount.

249
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:10,327
No.

250
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:12,095
I'm just saying,

251
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,831
as much as I appreciate
the gesture,

252
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:18,101
the money you gave me
doesn't really change anything.

253
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,772
- Because it's not enough?
- No. No.

254
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,607
Don't twist my words.

255
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:25,609
This isn't about amounts.

256
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:28,011
This is about me
doing the right thing.

257
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:32,115
- Ted, are you blackmailing me?
- What?

258
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,585
No. Blackmailing?

259
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,219
God.

260
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,023
I feel like I'm not
explaining things right.

261
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:42,693
I think you're
explaining it fine.

262
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:49,499
I notice that, uh,

263
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,301
this is for...

264
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:54,338
less than what I gave you,
by the way.

265
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:57,341
That's the Mercedes. I leased it before
I knew where the money came from.

266
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,744
Mmm. And now that you know, you
will, of course, be returning it?

267
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,746
Well, the leases
are pretty ironclad,

268
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:04,248
so I have to see
what's possible.

269
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:06,951
But, yeah,
I'm gonna do my best.

270
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:09,921
And I will pay you back
as soon as I can.

271
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:12,991
I don't want you
to pay me, Ted.

272
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:15,727
I want you to pay them.

273
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:16,995
But, Skyl--

274
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,535
Try it again.
Write a new check.

275

- Skyler--
- Same amount.

276
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:29,007
Only this time,
made payable--

277
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,243
- What happened to us?
- Make it payable

00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:29,587
any more news
on that thing in Mexico?

330
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:32,824
Aah, same old, same old.
Bunch of animals

331
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:36,161
clawing each other's eyes out
over turf.

332
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:38,563
So you think all the victims

333
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:40,565
were cartel members?

334
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,966
Not in the loop enough to know.

335
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,269
Listen, take a right
at this street here, will you?

336
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:47,873
A right? But, uh, we're going
to the chicken farm.

337
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:49,074
That's straight ahead.

338
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:51,376
No. Gonna take
a little detour.

339
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:55,346
All right.

340
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:57,548
Yeah, there's this, uh,

341
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,218
industrial laundry
I want to check out.

342
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:01,720
It's not far.

343
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:03,255
Just turn right here.

344
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,127
What, uh--
What-- What laundry?

345
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,829
What about it?

346
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:12,531
Well, it's owned
by this company--

347
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:14,032
this Madrigal Electromotive.

348
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:16,668
It's this big
German conglomerate.

349
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:19,371
Into everything.
Well, it turns out

350
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:23,608
it's the same company that owns
Fring's chicken joints.

351
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:28,146
[exhales forcefully, mutters]

352
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,117
Sounds like a real
shot in the dark there.

353
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:34,318
I mean, you said it yourself.

354
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:36,620
If this--
Madrigal, is it?

355
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:38,890
If it's such
a big conglomerate, then--

356
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:43,294
I mean, they must own
all kinds of businesses.

357
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:45,763
Nah, it just...

358
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:49,433
It just sounds kind of...thin.

359
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:52,469
Well, look at you. You lose your
hair, you go on a couple stakeouts.

360
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:55,439
So now you're what, Kojak?
[laughs]

361
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:56,941
I'm just saying.

362
00:23:56,975 --> 00:23:58,642
[clears throat]

363
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:00,845
Now, the chicken farm,
however--

364
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:03,414
boy, that place seems ripe

365
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:06,817
for some kind of, uh,
clandestine activity.

366
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:09,620
I just-- I just don't want us
to miss anything, you know?

367
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:12,423
Yeah, well, you want to talk
about clandestine activity?

368
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:15,559
Madrigal Electromotive
also owns a subsidiary

369
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:18,061
that manufactures
this state-of-the-art

370
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:19,563
air filtration system.

371
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:22,565
And none other
than Gale Boetticher

372
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,567
took delivery
of one of these systems.

373
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,568
Yeah, a chemist
who was in possession

374
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:29,604
of hand-drawn plans
for a meth super-lab,

375
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:33,041
and was visited
by none other that Gus Fring

376
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:36,244
just days before he was
capped in the face, okay?

377
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:38,179
Shit, this is starting
to feel like a--

378
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:40,915
like <i>Three Days on the Condor,</i>
you know?

379
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,317
Anyway, an industrial laundry
would be one hell of a place

380
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:46,187
to hide a--
hide a meth lab.

381
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:47,688
There it is right up there.

382
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:49,924
Just turn in there.

383
00:24:52,694 --> 00:24:55,462
Well, slow down.
You gotta turn there, Walt.

384
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,699
Walt, what are you doing?
You just missed it.

385
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:01,002
I'm sorry.
It looked like a dirt road.

386
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,937
I thought you meant further up.

387
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:04,271
[scoffs]

388
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:06,707
Just bang a U-ie
over here.

389
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:12,814
[brakes screeching]

390
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:23,173
Mmm. Hits the spot.
Thanks, guys.

391
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,742
I said to Mom, "Ice cream,"

392
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:28,745
but she was like, "It tastes
the same, and it's healthier."

393
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,682
So, sorry. I tried.

394
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:33,685
Frozen yogurt
does taste the same.

395
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:35,086
Tastes exactly the same.

396
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:38,089
Wow. I feel, like, sorry
for your taste buds.

397
00:25:38,124 --> 00:25:40,760
Weigh in here, Uncle Hank.

398
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:43,596
Hey, it's free food.
Free food always tastes good.

399
00:25:43,631 --> 00:25:45,432
Free drinks even better.

400
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:46,867
[Marie] Hey, hon.

401
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:50,003
Can you handle another visitor?

402
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:51,838
[Hank]
Ho-ho! Mister Magoo.

403
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,506
Yeah, sure.
Hey, watch out.

404
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,508
Don't run into any walls
or anything, all right?

405
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:58,211
[chuckling] Okay.

406
00:25:58,245 --> 00:25:59,612
Hey, Dad.

407
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:01,713
Hey, son.

408
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:03,715
So how you feeling, Hank?

409
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,717
Oh, well, you know.
Kind of feels like

410
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:07,219
one of those cones
they put on dogs

411
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:08,720
so they don't lick
their own balls.

412
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:11,622
Nice. Thank you.
Stay classy.

413
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,791
Anyway, hanging in there.

414
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:15,793
Glad you stopped by.

415
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:18,763
Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry
about all this.

416
00:26:18,797 --> 00:26:21,499
That guy--
he just came out of nowhere.

417
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:23,500
Yeah, actually, he didn't.

418
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:25,602
I saw him coming a mile away.

419
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:29,406
Hey, just mark it down
as a brain fart,

420
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:32,343
and be thankful
no one got killed.

421
00:26:32,377 --> 00:26:34,345
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

422
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,248
Your Hardy Boys routine
is over.

423
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:39,017
No more asking him
to drive you on stakeouts.

424
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:41,453
It's too dangerous.
You hear me?

425
00:26:41,487 --> 00:26:43,655
- I'll do it.
- Oh, no, you won't.

426
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:47,158
Marie's right. It was
a bit shortsighted of me.

427
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:49,160
That's why I caved.

428
00:26:49,194 --> 00:26:50,361
Caved?

429
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:51,863
I broke down.

430
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:54,099
I ordered me
a gimp-mobile.

431
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,635
[chuckles]

432
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:58,371
I wish you would
stop calling it that.

433
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:01,941
What do you mean,
like a handi-van with a lift?

434
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:03,610
Nah, nah.
It's a regular Tahoe.

435
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:05,112
It's got hand controls.

436
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:07,114
I ordered it.
It should be here in about a week.

437
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:09,116
I don't expect
to be in it long,

438
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,652
but I gotta
get around on my own

439
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:14,622
and stop being such
a damn burden to everyone.

440
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:17,792
[phone ringing]

441
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:20,161
Oh.

442
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,697
Oh. Sorry.

443
00:27:23,732 --> 00:27:25,666
Car wash business.

444
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,301
<i>[Saul]</i> <i>Hey, it's me.
</i> <i>Can you talk?</i>

445
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:29,803
I can listen.

446
00:27:29,837 --> 00:27:32,038
<i>Fair enough.</i>
<i>He doesn't own a gun.</i>

447
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:34,307
At least not one
that he bought legally.

448
00:27:34,341 --> 00:27:35,976
Nor does
his home security system

449
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,979
have any kind of panic button
arrangement.

450
00:27:38,013 --> 00:27:40,415
So, way I see it,
we're good to go.

451
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:43,251
That is, if this is still
how you want to handle it.

452
00:27:45,321 --> 00:27:47,922
Like I said,
I don't want anyone hurt.

453
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,926
All I want is for him
to write a check.

454
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,528
Yeah. It's gonna be fine.

455
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:54,363
I've got my A-team on it.

456
00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:57,633
[beeps] [sighs]

457
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:59,434
[beeps]

458
00:28:02,705 --> 00:28:04,472
[knocking on door]

459
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,148
Can I help you?

460
00:28:13,183 --> 00:28:15,517
Yeah. Thanks.

461
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:17,653
Whoa, whoa.
You just can't...

462
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:21,924
What's this about?

463
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,859
I'll tell you what
this is about, Mr. Beneke.

464
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:27,062
This is about you and me doing
our best to keep Huell happy.

465
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:29,064
Huell? Who's Huell?

466
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:30,432
This is Huell.

467
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,134
Huell, you happy?

468
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,969
Reasonably.

469
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,705
What would make you unhappy?

470
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:38,574
This little mofo
not doing what he's told.

471
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,709
And if you were
to become unhappy,

472
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:42,078
Mr. Beneke wouldn't care
for that?

473
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,580
I'm gonna say no.

474
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:46,148
Well, there you have it.

475
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,650
Let's go find your checkbook.

476
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,053
Ready? Here we go.
All right.

477
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:52,422
We're walking,
we're swinging our feet.

478
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:53,789
There you go.
Very nice.

479
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:56,458
Beautiful place you have here.
This way.

480
00:28:56,493 --> 00:29:01,630
So, the amount's gonna be
for $617,226--

481
00:29:01,664 --> 00:29:04,299
Whoa, whoa. I don't have anywhere
near that kind of money.

482
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,134
Hold that thought.
Forgot to mention

483
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:07,635
we know exactly,
down to the penny,

484
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,036
how much money's
in your checking account.

485
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:10,371
Okay? Understand?

486
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:12,907
You still want to say
that stuff from before?

487
00:29:12,942 --> 00:29:14,509
Maybe not. So,

488
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:18,180
$617,226

489
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,650
and 31 cents,

490
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:24,554
made payable to
the Internal Revenue Service.

491
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:27,324
W-What?

492
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,528
Wait.
This is, uh, Skyler's--

493
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:31,862
Skyler White sent you?

494
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,864
Doesn't matter who sent us.
For right now,

495
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:35,699
all you have to do
is worry about that.

496
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,635
Oh, my God. This is a giant
misunderstanding.

497
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:40,037
Skyler is a dear friend
of mine, all right?

498
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:43,106
Let me call her.
We'll, uh...

499
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:46,643
No, you're misunderstanding,
Mr. Beneke.

500
00:29:46,678 --> 00:29:48,846
Phone-call time is over.
This is check-writing time.

501
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,848
This is crazy.
Skyler would never do this to me.

502
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:52,550
Sit down and write!

503
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:58,090
There you go.

Yeah. Right.

507
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:12,573
You got it.

508
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:19,879
Huell, you happy?

509
00:30:21,015 --> 00:30:22,515
[laughs] Huell's happy.

510
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:25,017
All right.

511
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:27,886
Everything else
has been filled out for you.

All's we need

513
00:30:31,924 --> 00:30:34,393
is a signature

514
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:36,262
right there.

515
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,036
Great.

516
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,738
Hard part's over.

517
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:46,574
Here's what happens next.

518
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:48,676
Huell's gonna
hang here with you.

519
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,678
I'm gonna make sure
I get this down to UPS

520
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:52,346
before 5:00.

521
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:54,715
On the way back, I'm gonna
grab some sandwiches.

522
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:56,483
The three of us can hang out,

523
00:30:56,518 --> 00:30:58,352
play cards or watch TV
or whatever

524
00:30:58,386 --> 00:31:00,554
for the next couple of days
until the check clears.

525
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:03,558
Painless, right?

526
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:05,894
Unless you don't have cable,

527
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:07,829
in which case is gonna suck.

528
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:08,964

have to be dirty?

Nope.

Hmm.

535
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:46,928
Someone cooked here.

536
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:51,466
You've been out of commission
four days.

537
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:54,036
Think we're gonna shut down
the whole operation

538

just for you?

539

Who cooked?
Who was here?

540
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,754
[Jesse] Now, how are you
doing all those backflips?

All right. I'm sorry.

that you have been cooking
without me.

"So what"?

00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,944
what Gus is planning?

He's going to use you

you need me anymore.

I asked for your help,

what?

614

Kill me?

You can't kill me

619
00:37:57,886 --> 00:38:01,422

wouldn't cook for you

625
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:20,808
to screw with his head

626
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:23,911
so that he would hate my guts,

627

and he still...

628
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:31,018
won't let you do it.

matter of your brother-in-law.

you promised to resolve.

00:40:17,024 --> 00:40:19,092
Check's in the mail, at least.

654
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,894
Oh, hello, Mrs. White.

655
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:22,896
The good news is
the IRS has been paid off.

656
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:25,032
The bad news is...
[huffs]

657
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,066
Jesus!

658
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:30,137
- Well, here goes nothing.
[Francesca] - Hey!

659
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:31,905
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down!

660
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:32,939
- What the--
- Saul.

661
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,775
How did you hear?

662
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,910
What? H-Hear what?

663
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:39,245
Uh, guys, go, go, go.

664
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:40,980
Scram. Wh--

665
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:43,482
- What the hell happened to you?
- Saul-- Saul,

666
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:45,550
this man that we
spoke of before--

667
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:47,618
this-- this person
that you said

668
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,187
could-- could disappear me,
give me a whole new life--

669
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:52,156
- Yeah.
- And make sure that I'm never found.

670
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:53,792
- Yeah.
- I need him.

671
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:57,863
Saul, Gus is gonna
murder my whole family.

672
00:40:57,897 --> 00:41:00,032
Oh, Christ.

673
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:02,668
I need this man now.
[stammers]

674
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:04,737
Saul! Now, Saul!

675
00:41:04,772 --> 00:41:07,474
Yeah, yeah. You understand there's
no coming back from this?

676
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:09,709
You're gonna get new Socials
and new identities.

677
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:12,645
You can't contact your friends
or relatives ever again.

678
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,814
All right.
Yes, yes, I understand.

679
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:17,883
How are you gonna sell this to that
wife of yours and your teenage son?

680
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:19,351
I have got no choice.

681
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:21,486
You're wanted by some
pretty scary individuals,

682
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,821
not to mention the law.

683
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,156
You're a high-risk client.

684
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,656
You're gonna need
the deluxe service.

685
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,658
- It's gonna cost you.
- How much?

686
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,994
The last quote I got
on the deluxe was 125 grand.

687
00:41:31,029 --> 00:41:32,829
But you got four people
to vanish.

688
00:41:32,864 --> 00:41:34,398
It's gonna be
at least half a million.

689
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:36,801
- And he accepts cash only.
- I've got the money. Now come on.

690
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:38,302
- Please!
- Here.

691
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:39,503
Okay.

692
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:43,841
This-- This is a vacuum
cleaner repair company.

693
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,877
What'd you expect,
Haji's Quick-Vanish?

694
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:47,545
I don't even know
the guy's name.

695
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:49,580
You just call that number
and you leave a message.

696
00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:52,917
You tell them that you
need a new dust filter

697
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:56,253
for a Hoover MaxExtract
Pressure-Pro, Model 60.

698
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:58,755
I wrote it right on there.
He'll cal you back in five minutes.

699
00:41:58,789 --> 00:41:59,923
Okay. Okay, fine.

700
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:01,858
How long does it take
for him to arrange?

701
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,926
The guy works fast.
I mean, that's the game here.

702
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:05,494
You gotta have
your family packed

703
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:07,696
and ready to go
before you make the call.

704
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,197
He'll tell you
where to meet him.

705
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:11,533
He'll put you up in a safe
house until everything is set.

706
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:13,034
But you gotta bring the money.

707
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:15,237
He doesn't lift a finger
unless he's paid in full.

708
00:42:15,272 --> 00:42:16,939
Okay.

709
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:19,509
- Saul-- - Can't say it's
been a pleasure, but--

710
00:42:19,543 --> 00:42:21,945
I need you to do
one more thing for me.

711
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:23,680
You need to call the DEA,

712
00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:26,650
and you need to tell them
that Gus has a hit out on Hank.

713
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:29,721
- No, you have to do it for me.
- Buddy, I gotta go on living here.

714
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:33,324
- I'm way too comfortable in my wingtips--
- Just call anonymous then.

715
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,026
- You call anonymously!
- I can't! I can't!

716
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,362
I'm practically
in the DEA family.

717
00:42:37,396 --> 00:42:39,430
I go to their Christmas parties,
for Christ's sake.

718
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:41,632
They know me. They know my voice.
They'll know me.

719
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,567
Please, you gotta do it for me.
I'm begging you.

720
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,103
- Please. Please.
- No.

721
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:49,707
My brother-in-law doesn't
deserve to die because of this.

722
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:53,143
- There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.
- Okay.

723
00:42:53,177 --> 00:42:56,413
The best I'll go--
I'll say it's the cartel.

724
00:42:56,447 --> 00:42:58,581
They're coming back to finish
the job that they botched.

725
00:42:58,616 --> 00:43:00,283
You say whatever
you have to say.

726
00:43:00,317 --> 00:43:02,985
You just give me an hour
to c--

727
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,455
I-- I need to collect
my wife and kids.

728
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:07,156
Okay?
Just give me an hour,

729
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:08,658
and then you make
the phone call.

730
00:43:08,692 --> 00:43:10,560
Don't forget. Please.

731
00:43:10,594 --> 00:43:12,462
Yeah.

732
00:43:13,798 --> 00:43:15,732
Thank you, Saul.

733
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,971
[coughing]

734
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:27,378

735
00:43:43,528 --> 00:43:45,028
[grunts]

736
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:52,168
No, no, no, no.

737
00:43:52,203 --> 00:43:54,204
Where's the rest?

738
00:43:55,407 --> 00:43:58,609
That's not enough.
That's not enough.

739
00:44:01,147 --> 00:44:03,749
[Skyler] - Walt?
- Down here!

740
00:44:06,987 --> 00:44:10,356
Walt, what did
that phone call mean?

741
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:12,392
Where is it?

742
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:16,362
Where's the rest?

743
00:44:16,397 --> 00:44:18,998
The money, Skyler.
Where is the rest?

744
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,868
Skyler, where is the money?

745
00:44:22,902 --> 00:44:25,871
[panting]

746
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,143
I gave it to Ted.

747
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:35,848
What? You-- You did what?

748
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,283
Walt, I'm--

749
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:38,651
I had to.

750
00:44:38,686 --> 00:44:40,587
For us, for the family.

751
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:42,890
I swear, Walt.

752
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:44,926
You gave our money to Beneke?

753
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,897
Walt, please, please,
just hear me out.

754
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:49,998
Please!

755
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:53,168

757
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,975
Walt?

[laughing hysterically]

761
00:45:11,054 --> 00:45:12,520
Walt?

762
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:14,990
[ringing continues]

763
00:45:18,027 --> 00:45:20,696

It's happening again.

770
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:35,011
The DEA called.
They got some tip

771
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:37,380
from an informant that

772
00:45:37,414 --> 00:45:39,583
the cartel--
they want to kill Hank!
