1
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,341
There.

2
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,511
That's them.

3
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,608
Your play, Walter.

4
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,643
You're on your own.

5
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,894
Looks like you're about 1,000
gallons light here, Mike.

6
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,896
Where's the juice?

7
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,232
The methylamine isn't coming.

8
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,703
Why is that?

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,671
And who the hell are you?

10
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,173
I'm the man who's keeping it.

11
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,009
What the hell's this?

12
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:19,695
We had an agreement, right?
We got our deal.

13
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,681
- So where's the tank, Mike?
- Mike doesn't know where it is.

14
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:26,152
Only I do. And you're dealing
with me now, not him.

15
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,353
Why don't you just cut
to what it is you want,

16
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,522
or what you think is gonna
happen here, all right?

17
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,325
'Cause we're gonna get
what we came for.

18
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,695
That 1,000 gallons of methylamine
is worth more in my hands

19
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:39,381
than it is in yours or anyone
else's, for that matter.

20
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,384
But I need distribution.

21
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:44,887
Distribution.

22
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:46,872
That's right.

23
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,375
So if you agree
to give up your cook

24
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:53,229
and sell my product instead,

25
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:55,714
I'll give you 35 percent
of the take.

26
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:59,384
35 percent?
Wow. Are you kidding me?

27
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:02,721
35-- Mike, please tell
me this is a joke.

28
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:06,108
You know how far we had to stick our
necks out to get our hands on this cash?

29
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,893
And why the hell
would we want you?

30
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,912
You realize we have
our own operation, right?

31
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:12,581
I know all about
your operation.

32
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:16,001
My partners here tell me
that you produce a meth

33
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,455
that's 70% pure,
if you're lucky.

34
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,709
What I produce
is 99.1% pure.

35
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,244
So?

36
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:32,434
So... it's grade school T-Ball

37
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:35,104
versus the New York Yankees.

38
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:38,807
Yours is, uh, just some tepid,

39
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,094
off-brand,
generic cola.

40
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:46,098
What I'm making
is classic Coke.

41
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:48,867
All right. Okay.

42
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,819
So, um,

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,122
if we just waste you
right here,

44
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,291
right now,
and leave you in the desert,

45
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,876
then there is no more Coke
on the market, right?

46
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,629
See how that works?
There's only us.

47
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:04,616
Do you really wanna live
in a world without Coca Cola?

48
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,230
My partner tells me
that your crew

49
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,150
switched to a P2P cook
because of our success.

50
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,519
You dye your meth
with food coloring

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,187
to make it look like mine.

52
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:29,658
You already ape my product
at every turn.

53
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:31,443
But now...

54
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,862
you have the opportunity
to sell it yourself.

55
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,914
I need you to listen to me.

56
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,916
We're not gonna
give up this deal

57
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,036
to be your errand boys,
do you understand?

58
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,038
For what?

59
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,374
To watch a bunch of junkies
get a better high?

60
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:49,094
A better high
means customers pay more.

61
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,516
A higher purity
means a greater yield.

62
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,836
That's 130 million dollars
a profit

63
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:01,857
that isn't being pissed away
by some substandard cook.

64
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:04,727
Now you listen to me.

65
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,012
You've got the greatest
meth cook in a--

66
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,064
No, the two

67
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,650
greatest meth cooks
in America right here,

68
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,236
and with our skills,

69
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,789
you'll earn more from that 35%

70
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,857
than you ever would
on your own.

71
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,026
Yeah. So you say.

72
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:23,195
Just wondering why
we're so lucky.

73
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:25,130
Why cut us in?

74
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,083
Mike is retiring from our crew,

75
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,803
so his share of the partnership
is available,

76
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,972
if you can handle his end--

77
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,175
distribution.

78
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,394
And if you give him
five million dollars

79
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,396
of the 15 million
that you brought today.

80
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,581
Just think of it
as a finder's fee

81
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,817
for bringing us together.

82
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,454
We have 40 pounds of product
ready to ship,

83
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,189
ready to go.

84
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,492
Are you ready?

85
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,930
Who the hell are ya?

86
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,882
You know.

87
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,886
You all know exactly who I am.

88
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,756
Say my name.

89
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,426
Do what? I don't--

90
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:29,645
I don't have a damn clue
who the hell you are.

91
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,431
Yeah, you do.
I'm the cook.

92
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:37,102
I'm the man
who killed Gus Fring.

93
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,572
Bullshit.
Cartel got Fring.

94
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,107
Are you sure?

95
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,635
That's right.

96
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,806
Now... say my name.

97
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,930
Heisenberg.

98
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,101
You're goddamn right.

99
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:21,168
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

100
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,249
I gotta hand it to you, Walter.

101
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:53,372
Hey.

102
00:06:53,423 --> 00:06:55,791
I appreciate the kind words,

103
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:57,793
but I'm out too,

104
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:59,795
remember?

105
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:02,163
I know.
We'll talk.

106
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:07,219
Maybe we should talk
about how and when

107
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,504
I'm gonna get
my five million dollars.

108
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:11,640
And we will do that.

109
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,976
Absolutely.

110
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,028
It's just, you know--

111
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,614
Jesse, just give me
some time here, okay?

112
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:21,349
I'll need a little help getting things
up and running during this transition.

113
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,184
You can at least
do that for me, right?

114
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:27,873
Huh? Come on.
Don't worry.

115
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:30,542
We'll figure it out.

116
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,693
Well, I guess that's it.

117
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:06,995
Parting thoughts,
of which I have two...

118
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,947
First, as I said,

119
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:10,999
I'll handle the legacy costs
out of my end

120
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:13,418
so you won't have to worry
about my guys anymore.

121
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:15,454
Second, the bug.

122
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:18,590
The DEA will do a sweep.
Can't say when. Could be anytime.

123
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,792
But you need
to get it outta there,

124
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:22,844
sooner rather than later.

125
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:26,932
All right.

126
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,917
That's it?

127
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:32,253
No "thanks for
the five million dollars,"

128
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:35,440
no "sorry for chaining you
to a radiator"?

129
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:39,444
Just get the bug, Walter.

130
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:48,286
So, hey.

131
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,491
I guess, uh--

132
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,576
I guess I'll see you around.

133
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,878
No. Don't think so.

134
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:58,914
When I'm out, I'm out.

135
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,918
Well, I'm out, too, Mike.

136
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:07,806
Kid...

137
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,308
just look out for yourself.

138
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:54,853
Are we good?

139
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,888
You tell me.

140
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:00,675
Okay, Jesse.
Back it up.

141
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:04,179
You're good.

142
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:07,032
Keep it coming.
Straight back.

143
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,034
Slow it down.

144
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,069
All right.
That's good.

145
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,244
Hey, Mrs. White.

146
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:34,426
<i>Vamonos.</i>

147
00:10:34,477 --> 00:10:36,595
I wish.

148
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:39,347
All right. Let's get
this thing hooked up.

149
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:41,850
Walt...

150
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:49,157
What is this?

151
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:51,193
Do you really wanna know?

152
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:54,412
Why are you hiding it here?

153
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,031
Don't worry about it.

154
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:57,666
Who are you hiding it from?

155
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,702
I said,
"don't worry about it."

156
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:03,004
From the police?

157
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,841
Or someone else?

158
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,876
Someone who would kill for it?

159
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,212
Why don't you
go back in the office?

160
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:14,216
Why don't you
go back in the office

161
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,351
and let us do this?

162
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,637
We'll get it out of your hair.

163
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,868
Oh! What'd you
bring me this time?

164
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:54,071
They're bacon banana cookies.

165
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:57,357
Is there bacon in these?
Oh, my God!

166
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,359
Just bits.
Just little bits of bacon.

167
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:01,694
Just enough to make
those suckers really pop.

168
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:04,715
Dan, this is too much.

169
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,383
I'm not sharing those.

170
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,301
Bad office etiquette?
I don't give a crap.

171
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:10,804
- They're mine. - Well, they're yours
to do with as you please.

172
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:13,924
Good, 'cause my husband's
not getting any either.

173
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:16,259
- How is Mickey?
- Don't get me started.

174
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,261
He wants to buy a boat.

175
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:20,981
I can't even get him
to start the lawnmower,

176
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,683
and he wants to buy a boat.

177
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:25,318
Oh, I don't know.
A boat might be nice.

178
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,237
A little one, maybe.

179
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:30,323
Oh, please. Where would
you even take a boat?

180
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,692
All the way down
to Elephant Butte?

181
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:35,862
Or Caballo.
It's beautiful down there.

182
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:37,447
You can even leave it
at the lake

183
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:39,249
if you don't want
to haul it every time.

184
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,034
We are not buying a boat.

185
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:43,336
I'll tell you that right now.

186
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:47,457
- And the last one is 545.
- 569.

187
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,126
Aw, dang it.

188
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:51,244
- I almost got them all at time.
- Very good.

189
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:53,263
But actually,
I've got an extra one

190
00:12:53,297 --> 00:12:55,432
for you this week--
603.

191
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,717
603. Where is that?

192
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,686
- Right down there.
- Ah.

193
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:05,892
All right.
I'll let you get to it.

194
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:07,594
Thanks, Dot.

195
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:37,651
Young Kaylee's gonna need
a second safety deposit box

196
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:39,903
if you decide to leave
one more dollar to her.

197
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:41,187
Mm.

198
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:44,190
How's the rest of it?

199
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,293
Oh, it's empty, as usual.

200
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:49,195
The families are pretty
reliable with the pickups.

201
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,698
Nobody complaining about
wanting it all at once?

202
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:55,051
Nah, they get it.
Slow and steady wins the race.

203
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:58,755
So I guess this is it
for a while?

204
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:00,206
Mm.

205
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:02,709
Don't worry about the families.

206
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,895
They'll keep getting
their deliveries.

207
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:16,406
<i>I know times are tight,</i>
<i>but it's for the kids,</i>

208
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,609
<i>and your sponsorship</i>
<i>would sure be appreciated.</i>

209
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,578
<i>Yeah. We have</i>
<i>a, um, silver level,</i>

210
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:23,663
<i>but the gold</i>
<i>and platinum levels</i>

211
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:25,665
<i>really get your name out there</i>

212
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,702
<i>on the banners</i>
<i>and t-shirts.</i>

213
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:30,670
<i>Sure. No.</i>
<i>No, that's not a problem.</i>

214
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:32,672
<i>No, you call me directly</i>
<i>if things change,</i>

215
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:35,008
<i>you hear?</i>

216
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:37,844
<i>Gomie, take a brick to my head</i>

217
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:39,846
<i>if I ever have to make</i>
<i>another fun run call.</i>

218
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,798
<i>I'm done.</i>

219
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:44,301
<i>What's up?</i>
<i>Why you smiling?</i>

220
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:46,586
<i>'Cause the Ehrmantraut</i>
<i>warrant just came in.</i>

221
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:48,087
<i>Oh, baby, now we're talking.</i>

222
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:49,773
<i>How quick can you get</i>
<i>your group together?</i>

223
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:51,257
<i>- Two, three hours.</i>
<i>- Make it two.</i>

224
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:53,360
<i>We're gonna nail</i>
<i>that son of a bi--</i>

225
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:26,152
Police! Search warrant!

226
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:33,960
Police!
Search warrant!

227
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:35,462
Coming.

228
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:37,213
Hold your horses.

229
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:41,384
Search warrant.

230
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:43,636
Police!
Search warrant!

231
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:45,772
Police!
Search warrant!

232
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,204
Police!
Search warrant!

233
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:49,008
How's that restraining order
working out for you?

234
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:51,061
Uh, if you want me
to read that,

235
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:53,045
I'm gonna need my glasses.

236
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:01,554
<i>Too bad you had to make the trip
out from headquarters, Sergeant.</i>

237
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:03,356
<i>From out of bed, you mean.</i>

238
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,725
<i>When a cop kills himself,</i>
<i>they want a full report.</i>

239
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:11,698
<i>A single contact wound.</i>

240
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:13,950
<i>Powder burn on his temple</i>
<i>and right hand.</i>

241
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:15,452
<i>Suicide, I think.</i>

242
00:18:15,503 --> 00:18:17,420
<i>Tell the wagon boys they
can have him. Yes.</i>

243
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:19,422
<i>When I found him,</i>

244
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,541
<i>he-- he was dead.</i>

245
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:31,551
Hey! Perfect timing.

246
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:33,920
Just about to get started.

247
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:36,973
Uh, you know,

248
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,975
if you can get going
on that settling tank,

249
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:41,361
that would be a huge help.

250
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:44,931
We left that stuff in there
too long after the last cook.

251
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:47,266
- Mr. White--
- I mean way too long.

252
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:49,819
Now we have a tremendous
amount of residue.

253
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,605
You know what we need to
invest in is a power washer.

254
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:55,241
Mr. White,
can we just take a second

255
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,276
and talk about all this?

256
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,951
Yeah, yeah, sure.

257
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,619
Yeah.

258
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:08,171
Yeah.

259
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:12,976
Um-- uh, look, you know what

260
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,012
I think we need to talk about?

261
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:18,014
Is doubling down.

262
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:20,517
- Doubling down?
- Mm-hmm.

263
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:23,903
Cooking 100 pounds a week,
not 50.

264
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:25,905
As in starting
a new lab--

265
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,824
A lab that you'll run.

266
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:30,810
A cook all of your own.

267
00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:33,580
Why not?
You deserve it.

268
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:36,533
You're every bit as good as me.

269
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:39,485
Well, what do you think?

270
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:41,487
Mr. White, uh,

271
00:19:41,505 --> 00:19:45,842
I think that nothing
has changed for me.

272
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:49,796
I just wanna get my money
and-- and get out.

273
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:54,884
Jesse, this...

274
00:19:56,854 --> 00:19:59,138
What we do...

275
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,812
Being the best at something

276
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:07,814
is a very rare thing.

277
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:10,316
You don't just toss
something like that away.

278
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:14,988
And what, you wanna
squander that potential?

279
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:17,857
Your potential?
Why?

280
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,993
To do what?

281
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:21,995
I don't know.

282
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:23,830
Well, think.

283
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:26,499
To do what, Jesse?

284
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:32,055
Well, I'll figure it out,
all right?

285
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:34,206
Look at you.

286
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:36,226
What have you got
in your life, huh?

287
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,645
Nothing. Nobody.

288
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:40,563
Oh, wait. Yes.

289
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:43,066
- Video games and go-carts.
- Mr. White--

290
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,019
And when you get tired
of that, what then? Huh?

291
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:49,555
And how soon will you
start using again?

292
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:54,027
Look...

293
00:20:54,061 --> 00:20:56,562
Look, I know how upset you are

294
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,231
about what happened
to this boy.

295
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,252
I am just as upset as you are.

296
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:05,622
Are you? Really?

297
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:10,409
How can you say that
to me? Jesus!

298
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:13,046
I mean, I'm the one
who's the father here.

299
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,382
What, do I have to curl up in a
ball in tears in front of you?

300
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,417
Do I have to lock myself
away in a room

301
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,419
and get high
to prove it to you?

302
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:22,972
What happened to that boy
is a tragedy,

303
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:25,424
and it tears me up inside!

304
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,426
But because it happened, what,

305
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:29,428
am I supposed to just lie down

306
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:31,430
and die with him?

307
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:32,982
It's done!

308
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,984
It makes me sick
that it happened,

309
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:37,937
just like everyone else
who has died in our wake.

310
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:39,872
What Todd did--

311
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:43,609
You and I have done things
that are just as bad.

312
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:44,944
Yeah.

313
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,946
All the people
that we've killed--

314
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:50,166
Gale and the rest...

315
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:52,168
If you believe
that there's a hell--

316
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:55,171
I don't know if you're into that.
But we're...

317
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:57,623
We're already pretty much
going there, right?

318
00:21:57,641 --> 00:22:01,144
But I'm not gonna lie down
until I get there.

319
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:05,648
What, just because I don't wanna
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

320
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:08,300
How many more people
are gonna die 'cause of us?

321
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,469
No one. None.

322
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:13,189
Now that we're in control,
no one else gets hurt.

323
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,110
You keep saying that,
and it's bullshit every time!

324
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:19,612
- No.
- Always! You know what?

325
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:22,532
I'm done, okay?

326
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,534
You just give me my money,

327
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:27,036
and you and I--

328
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:29,339
we're done.

329
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:35,128
Hmm. Okay.

330
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,630
Why?

331
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:42,301
Why do you want this money?

332
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,190
Because it's mine.
It's my cut.

333
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:49,942
But isn't it filthy
blood money?

334
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:53,396
I mean, you're so pure.
You have such emotional depth.

335
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:56,199
No, no, no, no.
You shouldn't touch that dirty money.

336
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,818
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

337
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:01,487
Come on.

338
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:03,156
You want it.

339
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,742
You want it just as much
as I want it.

340
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,745
And it's not wrong to want it.

341
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:10,246
Okay?

342
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:14,133
So stay and work with me,

343
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:17,369
and you can make ten ti--
20 times as much.

344
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,644
Whatever, man.

345
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:28,097
You don't wanna pay me,
I don't care.

346
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:29,599
Yes, you do.

347
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,151
It's on you, all right?

348
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:35,104
- I'm done.
- No, you're not.

349
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:37,573
You're not done.
You're not leaving,

350
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:40,109
because if you leave,
you get nothing!

351
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,696
Do you understand me?
Nothing!

352
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,199
Jesse!

353
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:54,553
<i>Budget for the current fiscal
year for electronic surveillance</i>

354
00:23:54,587 --> 00:23:55,854
<i>is 1.5 million,</i>

355
00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:58,490
<i>on par with ATF</i>
<i>and the Marshal Service,</i>

356
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,959
<i>but still just a fraction</i>
<i>of FBI totals.</i>

357
00:24:00,993 --> 00:24:04,045
<i>We're lobbying congress</i>
<i>for an additional 1.41,</i>

358
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,181
<i>but we're waiting</i>
<i>on action reports</i>

359
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:08,800
<i>to demonstrate we're actually</i>
<i>getting worthwhile results.</i>

360
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:11,002
<i>Our undercover operations</i>

361
00:24:11,037 --> 00:24:13,522
<i>reap the most successful</i>
<i>actionable intelligence,</i>

362
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:16,224
<i>if you refer to the chart</i>
<i>in appendix four.</i>

363
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:19,344
<i>If ASAC Schrader can tell us</i>
<i>about the surveillance man-hours--</i>

364
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:21,813
<i>Hank?</i>

365
00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:23,565
<i>Hank?</i>

366
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:25,367
<i>Hank!</i>

367
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:29,237
<i>I think we're going</i>
<i>to wrap this up.</i>

368
00:24:29,288 --> 00:24:31,239
<i>If ASAC Schrader</i>
<i>can stay behind</i>

369
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,074
<i>while everyone else clears out.</i>

370
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,410
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

371
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:50,225
<i>You know no one wants</i>

372
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:52,394
<i>to see you succeed at this</i>
<i>more than me, right?</i>

373
00:24:52,428 --> 00:24:55,096
- Yes, sir.
<i>- I know how good you are.</i>

374
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:58,233
<i>I wouldn't have stuck my neck out
to get you here if I didn't.</i>

375
00:24:58,267 --> 00:25:00,602
<i>But you're not knocking</i>
<i>down doors anymore, Bubba.</i>

376
00:25:00,653 --> 00:25:02,771
<i>You're in charge</i>
<i>of an entire district office,</i>

377
00:25:02,822 --> 00:25:04,990
<i>and that comes</i>
<i>with responsibilities.</i>

378
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,192
<i>I mean, Hank, basic reports</i>

379
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:09,494
<i>aren't being filed</i>
<i>in a timely manner.</i>

380
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,413
I'll work on it.
It'll get better.

381
00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:13,832
<i>Yeah, it will, because way
too much time and money</i>

382
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:15,533
<i>is being spent</i>
<i>on the Fring case,</i>

383
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,202
<i>a case which is</i>
<i>essentially over.</i>

384
00:25:17,236 --> 00:25:19,087
<i>All this overtime</i>

385
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:21,373
<i>to surveil Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>

386
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:23,408
<i>That's just money that could</i>
<i>be better spent elsewhere.</i>

387
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,093
I understand,

388
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:26,911
but I'm not making
these choices lightly.

389
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:29,414
We've got increased reports
of blue meth on the street,

390
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:32,250
Fring's gang is still operational,
and Ehrmantraut is involved.

391
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:33,584
It's that simple.

392
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:35,586
<i>I believe you.</i>
<i>But so what?</i>

393
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:37,588
<i>It's one case out of dozens,</i>

394
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:40,558
<i>and you don't play favorites with it
just because it used to be yours.</i>

395
00:25:40,592 --> 00:25:42,560
- I really think that--
<i>- Don't play favorites with it, Hank.</i>

396
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:44,429
<i>You got a bigger job than that.</i>

397
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:46,431
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>forget the financial cost.</i>

398
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,933
<i>I hear you're personally serving
search warrants out in the field?</i>

399
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:51,236
That was an error in judgment.

400
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,288
- Won't happen again.
<i>- You're damn right it won't.</i>

401
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:55,290
<i>I'm just gonna bottom line</i>
<i>this for you.</i>

402
00:25:55,324 --> 00:25:58,326
<i>The surveillance budget</i>
<i>for Ehrmantraut is now zero.</i>

403
00:25:58,377 --> 00:26:00,412
<i>We clear?</i>

404
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:03,298
Sure. Thank you.

405
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:05,350
- Clear.
<i>- Good.</i>

406
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:07,385
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

407
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:19,514
Yeah?

408
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:22,633
Hey.

409
00:26:28,474 --> 00:26:31,242
So, Ramey wanted
to catch up with you?

410
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:33,161
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

411
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:35,113
Yeah.
Something like that.

412
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:38,033
No more following Ehrmantraut.

413
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:41,619
Not worth
the financial investment.

414
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:43,838
Well, it's not like
the guy's going anywhere.

415
00:26:43,873 --> 00:26:46,324
He's not even bothering
to throw our tails anymore.

416
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:48,343
He's just living
a boring old-man life

417
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:50,929
like he has nothing left
to hide.

418
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:52,964
And none of Fring's crew
is talking?

419
00:26:52,998 --> 00:26:54,632
Not giving an inch.

420
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,718
You sweeten the pot enough?

421
00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:00,021
Zero jail time and an
all-expense-paid trip to Maui?

422
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:02,173
Not that, but close.

423
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:03,841
Nobody wants to bite.

424
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,176
Christ!

425
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:07,278
They're either the most
loyal crew in history,

426
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:08,947
or someone's
still paying them off.

427
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:10,281
You still checking
bank records?

428
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:11,700
No one living
beyond their means.

429
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:13,651
Nine perps...

430
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:15,904
All being represented
by one lawyer.

431
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:18,189
Not unusual
in a case like this.

432
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:20,191
Yeah, this guy--
What's his name?

433
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:23,078
Daniel Wachsberger?

434
00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:26,214
He represents every one
of these douchebags

435
00:27:26,248 --> 00:27:28,533
except for Ehrmantraut.

436
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:30,868
Can we find out
more about the lawyer?

437
00:27:30,886 --> 00:27:33,138
You want me to start
tailing a lawyer?

438
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:35,724
Like the shit ain't deep
enough for you already?

439
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:37,726
Hey, Ramey said we couldn't
follow Ehrmantraut.

440
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,228
He didn't say anything
about anybody else.

441
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,713
Do it.

442
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:45,233
You're the boss.

443
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,129
All right.
Shall we get started?

444
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,131
Now, I know that most of this,

445
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:18,550
or all of this,
is gonna be new to you.

446
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:22,137
But, uh, did you take
chemistry in high school?

447
00:28:22,188 --> 00:28:23,471
Just basic?

448
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:25,807
No.

449
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:27,809
Okay.
That's all right.

450
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,612
As we go, I'll be as
detailed as possible

451
00:28:30,646 --> 00:28:32,781
without being overwhelming.

452
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:35,483
Yes, sir.

453
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:40,038
Look, Todd,
I-I don't need you

454
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:42,657
to be Antoine Lavoisier.

455
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,909
Uh, what I do need

456
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:47,245
is your full effort
and attention.

457
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,581
Listen and apply yourself.

458
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:52,584
If you do that,
then we just might have

459
00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:55,119
a fighting chance here, okay?

460
00:28:58,123 --> 00:29:00,625
- Okay.
- Okay.

461
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:04,312
Well, here we go.

462
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:20,028
Slowly. Steady.

463
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:37,262
The aluminum helps speed up
the delivery of hydrogen chloride.

464
00:29:42,384 --> 00:29:47,138
Gently pour it in.
No spilling.

465
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:29,380
<i>You're gonna like</i>
<i>the Little Schticky,</i>

466
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:31,048
<i>but you're gonna love</i>
<i>the Big Schhticky.</i>

467
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:33,551
<i>For bigger messes like dust
bunnies under the bed</i>

468
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:35,353
<i>or picking up after...</i>

469
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:16,644
Now...

470
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:19,948
The CO2 freezes the liquid,

471
00:31:19,982 --> 00:31:21,950
crystallizing it,

472
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:25,737
which gives us our
finished methamphetamine.

473
00:31:27,272 --> 00:31:30,708
Now all that's left

474
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:32,710
is to break it up, weigh it,

475
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:35,496
and we're done.

476
00:31:35,547 --> 00:31:38,783
Wow. This is, um...

477
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:40,951
This is complicated.

478
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,953
It's gonna take me
a few more times

479
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:45,807
to get a grasp on it.

480
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:47,308
Oh, yeah.

481
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:49,677
It'll take a few more times.

482
00:31:53,015 --> 00:31:55,099
I do all right?

483
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:58,486
You did fine, Todd.

484
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,323
You applied yourself.
That's as much as I can ask.

485
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:04,359
Now all that's left, I guess,

486
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,361
is to talk money.

487
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:09,247
We can talk money
once I get this right.

488
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:14,002
Hmm.

489
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:22,677
Morning.
Guess what I have.

490
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:28,216
Cake pops.
They're balls of cake on a stick.

491
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:32,387
Very nice.
Thank you, Dan.

492
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:34,939
See? I put little faces
on them.

493
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:58,496
Hey.

494
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:01,916
Hey.

495
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:19,934
All right.

496
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,509
Mm.

497
00:33:46,428 --> 00:33:49,764
I'm, uh-- I'm working
with a new guy now.

498
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:53,518
And I think that it...

499
00:33:53,552 --> 00:33:55,603
I think it

500
00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:58,689
could possibly work out,

501
00:33:58,724 --> 00:34:00,525
because...

502
00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:08,366
I'm trying, Hank.
I really am. I'm trying,

503
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,985
but there's this...

504
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:15,206
I mean, it's like I don't
even exist to her.

505
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,743
Well, yeah...

506
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:20,411
I mean,
I know she's struggling.

507
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:22,330
I know, but I-- I--

508
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:23,881
I just don't know what to do.

509
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:25,917
I mean, what can I do?

510
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:28,469
Such a mess.

511
00:34:29,972 --> 00:34:31,722
I mean, we--
both of us-- we--

512
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:35,292
we just have screwed up
so much.

513
00:34:37,146 --> 00:34:39,147
I'm just...

514
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:40,798
I'm sorry. I don't...

515
00:34:40,816 --> 00:34:43,184
Um, do you-- do you have any coffee?
Maybe I could--

516
00:34:43,235 --> 00:34:44,852
Coffee? You bet.
Yeah. You bet.

517
00:34:44,903 --> 00:34:46,354
What, you take, uh,
cream, right?

518
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:47,738
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

519
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:24,108
All right.
Here you go buddy.

520
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:26,010
- Oh, thank you, Hank.
- Yeah.

521
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:29,013
Look, I'm sorry to waste
your time with all this.

522
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:31,115
- Ah, no.
- It's really...

523
00:35:31,149 --> 00:35:33,150
- It's... You know.
- Yeah.

524
00:35:33,184 --> 00:35:35,036
Yeah.

525
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:40,858
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

526
00:35:40,876 --> 00:35:42,577
Hey, could you excuse me?

527
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:44,962
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.

528
00:35:44,997 --> 00:35:46,714
- Tell me something good.
- You tell me.

529
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,382
I sweated the guy for 14 hours.

530
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:49,884
That should be
some kind of record.

531
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:52,202
Quit your bragging.
What'd you get?

532
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:55,706
He's gonna do it.
He's gonna flip.

533
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:57,708
He's willing
to give us Ehrmantraut?

534
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:02,930
What are you wasting
your time for?

535
00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:04,932
Go throw a net around
that son of a bitch.

536
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:06,434
All right.

537
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:40,287
- Yeah?
<i>- Mike, hey, it's me.</i>

538
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:41,955
<i>- Can you talk?</i>
- I can.

539
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:44,875
<i>Great. Look, there's a small
situation with the money.</i>

540
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:47,026
<i>I don't want to do this</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

541
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:48,528
<i>Are you available?</i>

542
00:36:48,546 --> 00:36:50,530
I can come by in a few hours.

543
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:52,999
<i>That's not good for me.</i>
<i>Where are you now?</i>

544
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:55,535
I'm at the park
with my granddaughter.

545
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,421
<i>- Where exactly?</i>
- Palomita.

546
00:36:58,472 --> 00:36:59,923
<i>Oh, you know what?</i>
<i>I'm not far.</i>

547
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:01,591
<i>I'll come to you.</i>
<i>You just hang tight.</i>

548
00:37:09,734 --> 00:37:12,051
Yeah?

549
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:14,187
<i>Mike, they're coming for you.</i>
<i>Right now. They're coming.</i>

550
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:16,406
- Slow down, Walter. Who?
<i>- The DEA.</i>

551
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,892
<i>The DE--</i>
<i>Somebody flipped.</i>

552
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,912
<i>They have, uh, some--</i>
<i>some kind of bank surveillance.</i>

553
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:23,897
<i>And something</i>
<i>about some lawyer.</i>

554
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:27,200
<i>Someone is talking, Mike, and
they're coming for you right now.</i>

555
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,136
How could Mike use
that clown of a lawyer?

556
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:22,088
Dan Wachsberger.

557
00:38:22,122 --> 00:38:25,458
He would've had better luck with the
law firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp.

558
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:28,228
Always consult with me
before using outside counsel.

559
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:30,630
All right, Saul.
Enough, please.

560
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:33,016
Instead of just sitting
around here, what can we do?

561
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:36,653
Besides pray that he gets away?
I'm open to ideas.

562
00:38:36,687 --> 00:38:38,905
Because if the DEA
catches up with him,

563
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,308
and he flips,
it's good night, John-boy.

564
00:38:42,326 --> 00:38:46,029
No. No way Mike
would ever flip, okay?

565
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,164
- No way.
- Yeah, yeah.

566
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,500
Never say never.

567
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:54,087
This is the second time
the DEA has confiscated his bankroll.

568
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:55,755
You know?

569
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,824
Jesus, fool me once, right?

570
00:38:57,842 --> 00:38:59,158
Look, he won't flip.

571
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:02,796
But his nine guys will.

572
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:22,032
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
It's him.

573
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:25,652
Uh, Mike,

574
00:39:25,686 --> 00:39:28,204
uh, I got you on speaker phone
with the brain trust.

575
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,990
<i>- The what?</i>
- The, uh...

576
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:31,875
Walt and Jesse are here.

577
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:33,543
<i>I don't want Walt</i>
<i>and Jesse, Saul.</i>

578
00:39:33,577 --> 00:39:35,879
<i>- I want you. I need your help.</i>
- What do you need?

579
00:39:35,913 --> 00:39:38,214
I got a go-bag
at the airport--

580
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:40,884
passports, money--
but there are eyes everywhere.

581
00:39:40,918 --> 00:39:42,635
I can't get close.

582
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,704
I need you to pick up that bag

583
00:39:44,722 --> 00:39:46,840
and get it to me
as soon as possible.

584
00:39:46,874 --> 00:39:49,676
Do you know how thick the crap storm
is out there because of this?

585
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,845
I told you not to use that lawyer.
He's a hack!

586
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:54,481
- Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
<i>- Hey, Mike,</i>

587
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:56,016
I can get it to you, all right?

588
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,885
- Just tell me what to do.
<i>- No, kid. Not you.</i>

589
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:02,155
I'm paying Saul.
He can do the job just fine.

590
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:04,858
Yeah, you're paying me,
and the DEA knows I represent you,

591
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:06,860
so they're probably
sitting on my car right now,

592
00:40:06,894 --> 00:40:08,912
hoping I do something stupid.

593
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:11,064
Mike, I can do it, okay?
It's not a problem.

594
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:12,082
No, Jesse.

595
00:40:12,116 --> 00:40:13,416
Jesus, I'll do it.

596
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:16,036
Besides, you're out, remember?

597
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,071
Mike, tell me where
to get this bag.

598
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:34,047
Hello, Walter.

599
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:37,951
Before I hand this over,

600
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:39,486
I need something from you.

601
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,887
And what's that?

602
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:43,123
The names of your nine men.

603
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:45,925
Why?

604
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,461
You're never gonna pay them off.
What's the point?

605
00:41:48,495 --> 00:41:51,714
The point is, Mike,
it affects me.

606
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:55,301
It affects Jesse, too,
and we deserve to know.

607
00:41:55,335 --> 00:41:58,304
The only thing left
to do now is leave town.

608
00:41:58,339 --> 00:41:59,806
You understand?

609
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,008
"Leave town." Wow.

610
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:05,845
Yeah, I just can't up and
leave, like you, Mike.

611
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,348
I've got a family.
I've got people who depend on me.

612
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:11,317
Yeah.

613
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:28,801
Good-bye, Walter.

614
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:33,573
You're welcome!

615
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:39,345
I'm sorry, what?

616
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,898
I want those names, Mike.
You owe me that much.

617
00:42:41,932 --> 00:42:43,900
I don't owe you a damn thing.

618
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:47,720
All of this, falling apart
like this, is on you.

619
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:49,222
Wow.

620
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,157
Wow!

621
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:54,244
Oh, that's some kind of logic
right there, Mike.

622
00:42:54,278 --> 00:42:57,447
You screw up, get yourself
followed by the DEA,

623
00:42:57,498 --> 00:42:59,782
and now, suddenly,
this is all my fault?

624
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,451
Why don't you walk me
through this, Mike?

625
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:04,504
We had a good thing,
you stupid son of a bitch!

626
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:06,956
We had Fring.
We had a lab.

627
00:43:07,007 --> 00:43:09,876
We had everything we needed,
and it all ran like clockwork.

628
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,878
- Oh, my God.
- You could've shut your mouth,

629
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:15,131
cooked, and made as much
money as you ever needed.

630
00:43:15,182 --> 00:43:18,751
It was perfect.
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

631
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:21,420
You and your pride
and your ego!

632
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:23,723
You just had to be the man.

633
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:26,392
If you'd done your job,
known your place,

634
00:43:26,426 --> 00:43:28,611
we'd all be fine right now!

I just realized
that Lydia has the names.

637
00:45:47,368 --> 00:45:49,619
I can get them from her.

638
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,342
I'm sorry, Mike.

639
00:45:57,878 --> 00:46:01,214

00:46:01,248 --> 00:46:03,766
Shut the fuck up.

641
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:09,138
Let me die in peace.
