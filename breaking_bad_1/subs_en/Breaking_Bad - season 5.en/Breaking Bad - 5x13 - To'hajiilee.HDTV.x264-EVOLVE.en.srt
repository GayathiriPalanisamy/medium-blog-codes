Put out the lighter.

He can't keep getting
away with it!

5
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,368
He won't.
Do you really want to burn him down?

6
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:25,429
Let's do it together.
I put a wire on you, let him explain.

7
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,526
If I go to this plaza,
I'm a dead man.

Todd, I think I might have
another job for your uncle.

11
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:43,313
So, how big's the batch?

12
00:00:43,348 --> 00:00:45,298
Should be about 50 pounds,
give or take.

13

Uncle Jack, that mask...

14
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:49,519
I think you should...

15

Mr. White says the fumes
aren't good to breathe.

16
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:54,658
Let me worry about
what I breathe, kid.

17
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:57,143
Just hurry this up
so I can grab a smoke.

- Nice going, nephew.
- Thanks, Uncle Jack.

Where is the blue?

21
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:43,356
Where's the what?

22
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:44,858
The blue color.

23
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:47,494
Does it come later,
when this hardens?

24
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:49,529
Where is it?

25
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:54,301
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

26
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:57,304
See, I'm thinking the headline
here should be "76%."

27
00:01:57,338 --> 00:01:59,556
Yeah. Whole lot more
than it was.

That dude who looked like Wolverine--
he couldn't crack 70.

Fine. Yes,

30
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,847
percentage-wise,
it's marginally improved.

31
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:08,515
And congratulations, Todd.

32
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:11,217
But blue is our brand.
All over Europe,

33
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:13,770
it's what our buyers
pay top dollar for.

If we're down a bit in purity
from the Heisenberg days,

35
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:18,442
maybe they'll let us
slide on that,

36
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:20,861
but not if it's not blue.

37
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:25,031
I don't know.
To my eye,

38
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:26,700
it's kind of blue.

39
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:28,201
Yeah, a little.

40
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,003
It's blue-ish.

What do you think?

00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,766
Yeah, kinda...

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,801
If it catches the light
just right,

44
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:47,771
I could see how you'd think

45
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:49,756
there's a touch of blue,

46
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:52,025
blue-green in there.

you want.

50

- Yeah. Like they do farm-raised salmon.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,231
Jesus, you ever see how pink
they make that crap?

52

I made it just like you asked.

00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:41,007
Mm-hmm.

You sure?
If it's too weak or something,

00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:51,735
Look, about the product...

63
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:54,371
I'm really sorry
about the color.

64
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:57,356

it just got a few degrees too hot

in the mixing kettle, I think.

66
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:02,379
I might've just cooked the
color right out of it.

67

You burned it, like a cake.

68
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:09,803
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

69
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:11,805
But the point is
I think I can fix it,

70
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:15,308
and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

71

my brother-in-law can be.

162
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:31,104
Nice poker face.

163
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:33,023
Look, uh, relax.

164
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:35,675
There's not much new you can
tell me about Walter White.

165
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:37,677
Multiple murders,

166
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,013
uh, ties to a white power
prison gang,

167
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:42,699
ran the largest meth racket
in the entire Southwest.

168
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:45,402
I'm not asking,
you're not answering.

169
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:47,570
Whoop-de-doo.
Let's cut to the chase.

170
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:49,622
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

171
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:51,858
We intercepted a call
between him

172
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:54,544
and a certain Saul Goodman,
esquire.

173
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:57,213
You know, your employer.

174
00:10:57,248 --> 00:11:00,300
Anyway, in the call, uh, Walt said
that he was going to, quote,

175
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:02,969
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman,"
unquote,

176
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:04,888
and that you were next
on the hit list.

177
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:06,222
That's why you're here.

178
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:08,508
Bullshit.
That don't make no sense.

179
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,044
We got the recording.
I can-- I can let you hear it.

180
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:13,680
Your associate, Goodman's fixer--
What's his name?

181
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,982
Some carrottop
named Patrick Kuby.

182
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:18,651
Boston PD ran him out of
Beantown a few years back.

183
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:20,219
Came out here for the sunshine.

184
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:23,490
Yeah. Walt said he was gonna do this
Kuby guy the same way he does you.

185
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:25,692
In fact,
Kuby's already missing.

186
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,694
Sorry to say,
things are looking grim

187
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,562
for your--
your redheaded buddy.

188
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,066
Believe us, don't believe us.
Suit yourself.

189
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:35,585
Whatever you do,
I would not call Goodman.

190
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,570
He sold you
down the river big-time.

191
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:40,507
- The hell you talkin' about?
- Oh, don't take it personally.

192
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,409
Goodman's next on the chopping block
if he doesn't do what White says.

193
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:45,745
And to be fair,
your, uh, circus clown of a boss

194
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:47,764
did try to spare you
for all of, what,

195
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:49,766
about 15 seconds
[Chuckles]

196
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,751
Before he decided
to help Walt track you down.

197
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,754
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone,

198
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:56,422
and as soon as you call him,

199
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,424
uh, Walt's gonna find out
where you're hiding out.

200
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:00,944
And then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

201
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:05,398
[Scoffs]
Oh, man. Oh, man.

202
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:07,984
I swear to God, I didn't know
he was gonna kill the man.

203
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:10,070
I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
I didn't know.

204
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,604
- Relax.
- I didn't know he was gonna kill him.

205
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:13,123
If we thought you did,
you'd be in lockup

206
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:14,657
for conspiracy to commit murder

207
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,242
instead of here,
under our protection.

208
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:18,244
So just tell us everything
you know about White

209
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:19,746
so we can get him
before he gets you.

210
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,748
Why would he wanna kill me?

211
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,084
- I ain't do nothin' to him.
- Who knows with this guy?

212
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,219
From what he said to Goodman,
it may have something to do

213
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:27,887
with him trying
to tie up loose ends

214
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:30,590
regarding his poisoning
some kid named Brock.

215
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:34,811
Or maybe it's 'cause you know
where his money is.

216
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,763
I don't know
where his money is.

217
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,264
That ain't what we heard.

218
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:40,600
Well, you ain't listening
to the people in the know.

219
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,735
Me and Kuby
rented a van for the dude,

220
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,605
loaded his cash up
in a self-storage unit,

221
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,307
handed over the keys
to him at Goodman's.

222
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:50,660
And who knows
where he took it from there?

223
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:53,479
A van, huh?
How much money we talking?

224
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,665
Seven barrels' worth.

225
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,250
Seven barrels?

226
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,004
When you--
you say "barrels,"

227
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,006
you mean <i>barrels</i> barrels?

228
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,874
Barrels, man.
You know,

229
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:08,261
plastic, black,
55-gallon type.

230
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:09,762
I got 'em at Home Depot.

231
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:12,432
Filled up every last damn
one of 'em too.

232
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:15,685
And, uh, where did you
rent the van?

233
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,137
Lariat.

234
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,672
The one on Candelaria
and Monroe.

235
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:24,510
- Lariat on Candelaria?
- Yeah!

236
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:26,512
Kuby rented the van.

237
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,231
Mr. White dropped it off.

238
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:30,700
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

239
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:32,285
Wash the rental?
Why?

240
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:35,121
It was filthy, man,
like he had went off road with it.

241
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:38,374
After we had hosed it down,
he grabbed a shovel out the back,

242
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,127
handed over the key,
and that was it.

243
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:42,545
That's all I know.

244
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,251
All right, uh, Mr. Babineaux.

245
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:51,221
Agent Gomez and I

246
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:53,890
are going to, uh,
do everything we can

247
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:55,842
to find the son of a bitch.

248
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,644
Meantime, like I said,
you're free to go.

249
00:13:57,678 --> 00:14:00,230
But if I were you,
I wouldn't take one step out that door.

250
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:02,899
[Gomez] Right. And
remember, no phone calls.

251
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,684
Oh, almost forgot.

252
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,020
Uh, I took the liberty
of removing the battery

253
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,322
so Walt can't, uh,
track you by GPS.

254
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:12,242
So don't put that back in.

255
00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:14,527
Agent Van Oster
will stay here with you.

256
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,913
You're in good hands.
He's our best man with a gun.

257
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:19,232
Uh, however, don't discuss
the case with him,

258
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,901
because the less
you distract him,

259
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,587
the better he can protect you.

260
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:26,756
How long you gonna be?

261
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:30,043
As long as it takes
to keep you safe.

262
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,691
[Jack]
So just one guy this time.

263
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:46,976
Not even in lockup.

264
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:52,899
Some former partner, Todd says?

265
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:56,452
Yeah.

266
00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:58,738
So what are we talking,
rat patrol?

267
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:02,542
"Rat p--"

268
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:05,161
No, no.

269
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:08,498
"Rat patrol"?
No. No, he's not a rat.

270
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,784
He's just...

271
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,838
He-- he just...

272
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,057
won't listen to reason.

273
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:20,310
- Okay.
- He's just angry.

274
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:22,095
He's not a rat.

275
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,130
All right.

276
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,600
Angry, non-rat.
Got it.

277
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,352
How angry we talkin',
by the way?

278
00:15:29,403 --> 00:15:31,304
Like, Hulk angry?

279
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:36,276
Like, "Rambo James Bond
badass" individual?

280
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:42,332
Not something
you'd do yourself, huh?

281
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:46,452
Jesse is like family to me.

282
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:50,823
Look, I want what you do
to be quick

283
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,491
and painless.

284
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,594
No suffering, no fear.

285
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:57,764
Bullet to the back of the head.
Something he doesn't see coming.

286
00:15:57,798 --> 00:15:59,682
I respect that.

287
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:01,384
There's too many savages
out there.

288
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,336
Let's just talk
about the money.

289
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:05,521
[Chuckling] No,
we don't want your money.

290
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:08,775
We want you to cook for us.

291
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,727
[Scoffs]

292
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,571
You know I'm
out of the business.

293
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:24,324
Just a couple times
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

294
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,526
Get him on track
to bringing the purity up.

295
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:30,196
Get the color right too.

296
00:16:30,214 --> 00:16:33,049
Apparently that blue touch
you put on it--

297
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,501
it's all the craze
with those Slavic types.

298
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,003
So I'm told.

299
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:39,789
No. Absolutely not.

300
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:43,710
Look, what was the price
per head last time? I'll triple it.

301
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:47,214
That's a drop in the bucket compared to
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

302
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:49,916
Don't skimp on family.
That's what I always say.

303
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,635
You want us to do this job?

304
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:54,638
Do it right?
That's the price.

305
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,735
One cook...

306
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,488
after the job is done.

307
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:32,625
Time is of the essence.
Do you understand?

308
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:34,978
We'll do him tonight
if you want.

309
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,013
Just tell me where he is.

310
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:39,983
I don't know where he is,

311
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,970
but I know how
to flush him out.

312
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:49,663
You want String Cheese
or Yogurt Squeezers

313
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:51,165
with your PBJ?

314
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:53,083
Both.

315
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:56,086
- I didn't hear you.
- Both, please.

316

I don't know

I'm Walter White,

Yeah, of course. Hi.

Yeah. Oh, hi. Hi.

323
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:16,941
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this,

324
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:20,744
but, uh, I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

Um, okay. Sure. But I'm sort of
rushing around right now.

You met Brock before, right?

Yes. Yes, I have.

I don't wanna alarm you,

341
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,734
but I've-- I've been trying
to reach him for days.

342
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:02,236
I've stopped at his house.

343
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,838
I've left all kinds of messages
on his voicemail,

344
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:06,340
and he won't return my calls.

345
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:08,158
I can't find him anywhere.

346

Have you heard from him?

347
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:12,612
No, not since the last time
he called to check on Brock.

348
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,131
That was--
I don't know--

349
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:16,216
two weeks ago, maybe.

353
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:26,510
I have a bad feeling
about this.

354
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:30,347
Have you tried
calling the police?

355
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:34,935
Or, um--
a better idea.

356
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:38,305
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
I have his card somewhere.

357
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:40,107
I mean, he may have ways
of finding Jesse

358
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:41,825
without, you know,
getting him in trouble.

359
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,195
"Better Call Saul."
Yeah. I-- I did that.

360
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:47,698
He was able to verify
that Jesse's not locked up.

361
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:51,919
But otherwise,
very little help.

362
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,456
See, the thing is

363
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,709
is that Jesse and I
had this argument recently.

364
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,179
And I-- I won't bore you
with the details, but, uh,

365
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:04,765
he's-- he's--

366
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,802
he's pretty upset
with me, and, uh--

367
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:11,805
and I'm hoping that's the reason
he hasn't called me back

368
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,607
instead of...

369
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:16,360

370
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:18,412
Well...

371
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:23,350
Well, I'll try him right now.

he's mad at you,

maybe I'll have better luck.

Good to meet you.

Okay.

Make sure you get in there

booger powder in there,

All 200 of them?

Huell's gone.

He's not answering his phone.

So what about Jesse?

495
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:03,062
He hasn't shown up yet.

496
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,698
He will, Saul.
He's probably high as a kite somewhere

497
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,617
and hasn't gotten
our message yet.

498
00:26:07,668 --> 00:26:10,286
Or he got it loud and clear
and figured out it's a setup.

499
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:13,122
The kid is not as dumb
as you think.

500

Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

501

Did you miss the part about
my bodyguard has gone missing?

502
00:26:24,935 --> 00:26:27,854
Look, I had him
watching the dog house,

503
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,856
figuring the kid might show up
for a fix.

510
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:51,077

You mark "ten"

and then you subtract ten from
the actual stock column here.

Took it in the backyard

you save us the busywork, Walt,

you have the right
to remain silent.

in a court of law.

You have the right

and have an attorney present
during any questioning.

If you cannot afford
an attorney,

689
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:11,989
one will be provided for you
at the government's expense.
