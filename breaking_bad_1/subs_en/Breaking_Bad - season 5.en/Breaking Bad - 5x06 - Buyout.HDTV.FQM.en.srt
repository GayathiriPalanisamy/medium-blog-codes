That's where you do it.

3
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:06,291
- What, exactly?
- Get your methylamine.

4
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:08,295
Rob it?
Like Jesse James?

5
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:10,043
The children cannot be here.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,539
You agree to that and I will be whatever
kind of partner you want me to be.

7
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:15,788
Legacy cost.

8
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:18,259
It should come out of your end.

9
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:21,163
No one can ever know
that this robbery went down.

10
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:22,377
Absolutely.

11
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:26,873
No!

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,478
No.

13
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:55,393
You guys didn't tell me this
stuff smells like cat piss.

14
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:14,913
Man.
Shit happens, huh?

16
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:40,154
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I had to do it.

17
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:44,725
Obviously, I guess
you see it different.

18
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,760
Some of you. But I didn't see
any other choice.

19
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:48,262
I've been thinking
about this all day,

20
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:50,130
going over and over
it in my head,

21
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:51,815
and it was the only way.

22
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:56,236
Well, it's not like
I wanted to.

23
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:58,638
The kid was on a dirt bike.
I mean, he could've just--

24
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:00,107
He could've just gunned it
and been gone

25
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:01,975
before we even
had a chance to blink.

26
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:03,193
We never would've been able
to catch him.

27
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:05,329
I was thinking on my feet.
I saw a threat,

28
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:07,414
and I took care of it
the only way that I could.

29
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,999
A threat?

30
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:11,502
The kid was waving at us.

31
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:13,837
He wasn't going anywhere.
He was saying hi.

32
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,205
Yeah, but you don't know that.

33
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:16,673
Yeah, I do.

34
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,008
He didn't know what he'd seen.

35
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:19,259
Well, I didn't want
to take that chance.

36
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:21,795
I-- The whole point
of this thing was that no one

37
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,881
was supposed know that we
were even there, right?

38
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,717
People weren't ever supposed to
know that anything got robbed.

39
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:28,886
How could we have let
the kid go?

40
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,637
He made us. If I hadn't
done what I did,

41
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,172
the whole mission
would've failed.

42
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,174
I'm-- I'm real sorry.

43
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:39,446
I really am, but I--
But did I make a mistake?

44
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,648
Mr. White? 'Cause to me,

45
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:43,233
you know, respectfully,

46
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:44,234
I was looking out for the team.

47
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:45,786
I didn't want to kill him.

48
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,288
You gotta believe that.

49
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:52,326
At the end of the day, it was
him or us, and I chose us.

50
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,745
And I would do it again.

51
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,382
Okay, look. Uh...

52
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:03,053
Todd, why don't you step
outside for a few minutes

53
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:04,805
so we can talk this through?

54
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,807
Of course.
Yeah, you guys talk.

55
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,258
But I just want to make sure

56
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:10,511
that you know that my priority
is this business.

57
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:12,879
Okay. That's-- that's fine,
Todd. Thank you.

58
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:15,232
I want to be
a real part of this.

59
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,317
All right? If you could
just see that. I'm motivated.

60
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:18,902
And I've got connections.

61
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:21,488
Yeah. My uncle's got
his hookups in prison

62
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:23,857
who I think could be
a real help to us if--

63
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:36,736
Okay. That dude?
Whack-job.

64
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:38,372
Let's just stick
to the facts here.

65
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:40,374
Facts? Oh, okay. Uh...

66
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:42,793
How about the fact
that he shot a kid?

67
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:44,795
A kid that he
didn't need to shoot.

68
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:46,680
The boy had seen us.

69
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:51,351
And, no, it didn't look like
he knew what he was seeing.

70
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:54,805
But what if he told somebody?

71
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:57,891
What if he just mentioned it
in passing?

72
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,943
We can't know what someone--

73
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:03,763
Exactly. We can't know, because
Ricky Hitler there shot him.

74
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:07,601
We, us three, should've had
a discussion about it.

75
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:08,986
We would've figured it out.

76
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,456
But that dickhead just went ahead
and made the choice for us.

77
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,107
Is that how we do business now?

78
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,442
Look, I understand
you're upset.

79
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,294
And what was that crap
about his uncle

80
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,079
with the-- with the prison
connections?

81
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:22,115
It's just some bullshit
intimidation move.

82
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,950
- Come on.
- It's true, though.

83
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,503
He does have some connections.

84
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:27,588
Is this a problem?

85
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,257
No. It's nothing
to be concerned about.

86
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,792
It came up in the background
I did on him.

87
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,629
Didn't worry me then.
He's just flexing.

88
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:41,151
All right.

89
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:43,303
It seems to me that we have
three options here,

90
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,522
and none of which are ideal.

91
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:48,659
One, we fire Todd.

92
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:52,195
- Yeah.
- I'm not a fan of this option,

93
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:55,482
seeing that he knows way too much
about this business at this point.

94
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,586
And we'd most likely have
to pay him to keep quiet.

95
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:03,040
And God only knows we've got
enough of that going on.

96
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,511
Two...

97
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:09,129
We dispose of him.

98
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,172
Which leaves us option three.

99
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,174
We keep him on payroll.

100
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:24,895
Put him back on tenting houses,
setting up the lab and so forth.

101
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:28,532
We keep him close.
Under our control.

102
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:33,654
Now, option three
would be my choice.

103
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:35,656
Shall we vote?

104
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:41,194
I vote three, kid.

105
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:57,427
You're still in.

106
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,316
Right on.
Thank you so much.

107
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,400
You guys totally made
the right--

108
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,404
The next time you bring
a gun to a job

109
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:09,889
without telling me,

110
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:13,393
I will stick it
up your ass sideways.

111
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,197
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,971
Hey, boss. What's up?

113
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:17,424
I was just in the neighborhood.
Anything going on?

114
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,626
No. He's just hanging out
with his granddaughter.

115
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:22,229
Well, isn't that sweet?

116
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:23,980
Here, let me see.

117
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:06,022
It's a dead drop.

118
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:07,524
- What?
- A dead drop.

119
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:10,193
He just stashed something
underneath that trash can.

120
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,729
Write the time down.
Roll on it.

121
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,485
Looks like he's leaving now.

122
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:23,957
- Anybody coming for it?
- Nope, not that I can see.

123
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:27,711
Nobody in sight.
Could be hours.

124
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:30,046
Could be.

125
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:32,249
What do you want to do?

126
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:15,217
<i>It's not my fault that
Murtha's got his panties in a twist.</i>

127
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,718
<i>It's an HR issue, Janice--</i>

128
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:20,422

136

138
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,580
<i>This guy is slippery as hell.</i>

139
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,833
<i>He's been throwing</i>

140
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:53,138
<i>The guy's a pro.

141
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,808
<i>One of these days, our pal</i>

142
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,311
<i>Just gotta be there</i>
<i>when he does.</i>

143
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:08,320
Teenagers. Sometimes you
just want to strangle them.

144
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,473
How's it going?

145
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,493
Oh, you know...
This little munchkin,

146
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,112
I could just keep her forever.

147
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:21,166
She is just the sweetest
little baby ever born.

148
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,984
- Yes, she is.
- Oh.

149
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,788
I don't see much of Flynn.

150
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:29,124
That car of his keeps
him pretty busy.

151
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:31,710
Yeah.

152
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:35,047
More importantly,
how are you doing?

153
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:36,298
I'm okay.

154
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,333
How's the therapy?

155
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:42,104
I know Dave helped me so much

156
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:44,839
when I was going
through my little...

157
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,775
How's your guy? Um...

158
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:47,842
- Peter.
- Peter.

159
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,228
He's, um, yeah, he's good.

160
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,732
I feel like I'm
making progress.

161
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,033
That's great.

162
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:59,071
You know, you just keep
working through it.

163
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,694
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, honey.

164
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,831
Babe, what is it?

165
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:12,084
It's okay. It's all right.

166
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,536
Just-- Why don't you let me take Holly,
and then we'll talk about this?

167
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,887
No. No, no, no.

168
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,389
Okay.
All right, that's fine.

169
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,591
Then how about you
just talk to me?

170
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:22,144
Just tell me what's going on.

171
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,596
I just...

172
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,482
I need to make
the right decision.

173
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:29,985
I need them to be safe.

174
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,603
The kids?

175
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:34,823
They're safe.
Of course they are.

176
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:37,859
I just miss them so much.

177
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:39,661
I just want to be with them.

178
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:42,447
Hey, you know we can bring them
back home anytime you want.

179
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:44,249
No.

180
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,500
They need to stay.

181
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:49,588
But I just...

182
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,623
I don't know what
to do here. I--

183
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:55,743
Like, whatever I choose
is wrong.

184
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,748
Skyler, you have to tell me
what's going on.

185
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:06,388
I-- I know sometimes you...

186
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:09,524
I know you think I have
a big mouth sometimes. I...

187
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:14,112
But if you felt like you
couldn't talk to me,

188
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,148
I don't know what I'd do.

189
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,533
Okay. So...

190
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:21,987
So what's this about the kids
not being safe?

191
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:26,074
Safe from what?

192
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,627
From us.

193
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,413
From Walt and me.

194
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:35,417
Like what?
Like you're bad parents?

195
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:39,621
Because you're not.
Not even close.

196
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,623
Marie,

197
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:45,143
there are things you
just don't know.

198
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,129
That if you knew,

199
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,132
you'd never speak to me again.

200
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,354
Try me.

201
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:06,198
Okay. If you're
not gonna say it, I will.

202
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,701
Skyler, you have to forgive
yourself for Ted.

203
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:10,835
What?

204
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,538
You can't keep
beating yourself up

205
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:17,842
over some stupid little affair.

206
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,427
Uh...

207
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:21,463
- Walt told you.
- Please don't blame him.

208
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:25,050
I practically forced him to, and
I wasn't gonna say anything.

209
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,603
But I cannot stand to watch you
torture yourself like this.

210
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:30,838
You have to forgive
yourself, Skyler.

211
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,341
You were having
all these problems with Walt.

212
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,278
And Ted is
a really good-looking man.

213
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:41,533
You're only human.
Hell, I've even thought of, you know...

214
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:46,854
I mean, not seriously, but I
totally get your temptation.

215
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,241
Yeah.

216
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:56,164
Doesn't it feel good
to get it off your chest?

217
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,968
Oh, yeah.

218
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:01,753
I feel better.

219
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,472
Yeah.

220
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,514
<i>For those who love</i>
<i>the taste but not the price,</i>

221
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,733
<i>there's simulated caviar</i>
<i>made of kelp,</i>

222
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,351
<i>a type of seaweed.</i>

223
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,069
<i>A fraction of the cost,</i>

224
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,989
<i>it looks, smells, and tastes
similar to the real thing.</i>

225
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,693
Ready to get back at it?

226
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:28,246
<i>Unlike fish caviar--</i>

227
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,897
We have breaking news
into our newsroom.

228
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,067
We've just learned that police
are now expanding their search

229
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,588
for a missing Mckinley County boy
after four days with no leads.

230
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:41,242
Fourteen-year-old Drew Sharp was last
seen by his parents Thursday morning.

231
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,211
Authorities are extending
their search today

232
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:46,548
east from Crownpoint to Hospah
and White Horse.

233
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,600
Sharp was last seen
riding his dirt bike

234
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,685
into the desert
behind his house.

235
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,587
Investigators are asking any--

236
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:04,115
Jesse, nothing can change this.

237
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,619
Yeah. It's just
that kid's parents--

238
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,289
I know. Believe me.

239
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,375
I haven't been able to sleep
the past few nights

240
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,460
just thinking about it.

241
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,795
But, Jesse,

242
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,131
now, finally, we're
self-sufficient.

243
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,467
Finally we have everything
that we need,

244
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,753
and no one to answer to
except ourselves.

245
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,957
And in a year, year and a half,

246
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,143
once we've cooked through this
methylamine and made our money,

247
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:35,630
there will be plenty of time
for soul-searching.

248
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,266
Until then...

249
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,101
We keep going.

250
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:43,571
And we-- we run our business
our way

251
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:46,608
and make sure that this
never happens again.

252
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,197
Okay?

253
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:54,582
Look.

254
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,651
Listen, I'll-- I'll
finish this up.

255
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,421
Why don't-- why don't you
go on home? Hmm?

256
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,290
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

257
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:05,293
Yeah.
I'll take care of this.

258
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:08,680
You go on.

259
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:54,726
Hey.

260
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,010
Yeah, I was just leaving.

261
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,516
All right.

262
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,674
Hello?

263
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,242
Walter?

264
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,578
What are you doing here?

265
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,714
I'm delivering the batch.
What are you doing here?

266
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:37,936
Might as well get this
over with. Come in. Join us.

267
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,561
- Hey.
- Hi.

268
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,149
Where's your cars?

269
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,735
We parked around the block.

270
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,987
You might consider
doing that as well.

271
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,292
Okay.

272
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:12,954
So what's going on?

273
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:17,308
Just since this morning,
I threw three separate tails. All DEA.

274
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,293
- What?
- The feds have been all over me.

275
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,480
This has been going on
for a while now.

276
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,065
Did they follow you here?

277
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,800
No.
I said I threw them.

278
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:29,571
I would never come to the headquarters
of our illegal meth operation

279
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,489
dragging a bunch of cops,
Walter.

280
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,325
It would be unwise.
How can you be so sure?

281
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,693
Well, I've been doing this
a long time.

282
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:37,278
It's pretty basic stuff.

283
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,982
How long has this
been going on?

284
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,985
Since about the time we
started this little venture.

285
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:47,539
The DEA, in particular
your peach of a brother-in-law,

286
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,208
has taken a keen interest
in my activities.

287
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,710
And you're just
telling me this now?

288
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:55,329
What, you didn't think this
information would be of interest?

289
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,881
Wouldn't be germane?

290
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,516
I've been handling it, Walter.

291
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,935
We're sitting
on a thousand gallons

292
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,305
of stolen methylamine. Jesus!
How can you be so irresponsible?

293
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,890
Calm down, would you please?

294
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:08,476
I can't believe that you
kept this from me. From us.

295
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,510
Did you know about this?

296
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,728
Mike just told me.

297
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:13,197
And I said calm down.
I've got it under control.

298
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,149
Oh, well, forgive me

299
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,735
for not having
complete confidence.

300
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:19,737
You know this can't
go on, right?

301
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:21,188
Yeah, I know.

302
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,791
And I've already decided.

303
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:27,194
I'm out.

304
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:39,707
Okay. Well...

305
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,876
Sorry to see you go, Mike.

306
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,395
But I really don't see
any other way.

307
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,047
Neither do I.

308
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,565
Obviously, Jesse,

309
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,319
you'll have to take over
the distribution end of things.

310
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:54,439
Mike, I trust that you'll
bring Jesse up to speed

311
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,491
on your side of the business?

312
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:59,577
Yeah.
Um, about that.

313
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:02,563
Actually, Mr. White, um...

314
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,035
I'm out too.

315
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:11,238
You're what?

316
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,743
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

317
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,962
So, um...

318
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:20,715
I'm retiring, I guess.

319
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:24,769
That methylamine that we stole, that we
nearly killed ourselves trying to steal,

320
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:30,441
that methylamine, when cooked,
is worth nearly $300 million.

321
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:33,861
And you're telling me that you're
willing to walk away from that?

322
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:35,930
We're walking away
from the meth.

323
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,482
Not the methylamine.

324
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:40,485
Jesse and I will be taking our
two-thirds and we're selling it.

325
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:44,372
I've got a connection, a guy I
knew from my time with Fring.

326
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:48,159
This guy has the capital,
and he's motivated. Highly.

327
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,329
Mike's thinking we'll clear,
like, five million. Each.

328
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,832
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up
out of my share.

329
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,284
And those legacy costs
that you're so fond of,

330
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,303
you won't have
to worry about anymore.

331
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,123
And then I will be
going on my way.

332
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,474
Jesse too.

333
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,228
It's a solid plan.

334
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:10,631
You can come in on this
with us.

335
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,300
That'd be cool.

336
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:17,271
'Course, you know, you are
free to hold onto your third

337
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:20,908
and keep cooking.

338
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,831
You'll be selling
to my competitors.

339
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,701
This guy and his crew
are way out in Phoenix.

340
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:32,170
It's a big country, Walter.

341
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,922
Whole lot of meth-heads.

342
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:37,508
Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.

343
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:40,161
And that's what you're gonna
sell out for?

344
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,181
Pennies? Why?

345
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,217
Five million isn't pennies.

346
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,136
It's more money
than I've ever seen.

347
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,139
And when it comes down to it,

348
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:53,725
are we in the meth business?

349
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,977
Or the money business?

350
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,427
Relax, kid.
There's no one there.

351
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:13,596
You sure?

352
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,598
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

353
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,930
Glad to see
you could make it out.

354
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:50,166
I was surprised
to get your call.

355
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,269
Good surprise, I hope.

356
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,671
There's one gallon,
as discussed.

357
00:25:55,705 --> 00:25:58,307
You take that back home
to your people, test it.

358
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:02,044
If you're satisfied,
I can get the other 665.

359
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,596
All right.
That's fair enough.

360
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:06,182
Shall we talk money?

361
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:07,850
That one's free.

362
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:10,853
The price for the rest
is 15,000 per...

363
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:15,741
665 gallons, that's 9,975,000.

364
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:19,028
Although I would prefer
you round it up to ten.

365
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:22,665
Makes it easier
for my partner and I to split.

366
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:23,699
Steep.

367
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:27,569
Mm. We good?

368
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,572
Yeah. I'll talk to my guys,
but I should be able

369
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,907
to put together
that cash, yeah.

370
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,125
Good.

371
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,844
I gotta tell you,
this is worth it

372
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:37,179
just to get that blue stuff
of yours off the market.

373
00:26:42,752 --> 00:26:45,554
The blue stuff will be
off the market, right?

374
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:53,896
Now, this whole time,
I was thinking 666,

375
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,932
that seems like an odd number.

376
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,734
Two-thirds
of an even thousand, though.

377
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:03,322
When I look at it that way,
it starts to make sense to me.

378
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,958
That's not all
the methylamine, is it?

379
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,330
You two have a partner
you haven't mentioned?

380
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:15,501
This other party wouldn't be
a problem for you.

381
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,419
His territory
won't impact yours.

382
00:27:17,453 --> 00:27:18,804
You see, that doesn't
work for me.

383
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,422
I'm not just buying this
for the supply.

384
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:21,724
I'm buying this for the demand.

385
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:24,626
I'm looking to increase
my market share here, Mike.

386
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,812
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

387
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:29,181
I want you to tell me
that Fring's blue

388
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,966
will be off the streets.

389
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:39,858
All right. Here's
a new deal for you then.

390
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:45,030
I'll pay you 15k a gallon
for the full thousand gallons.

391
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:48,984
Not a drop less.

392
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,787
It's not mine to sell, Declan.

393
00:27:51,821 --> 00:27:54,957
Well then, no deal, Mike.

394
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:21,016
Yes?

395
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:24,119
Yes. I guess.

396
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:28,407
I don't know.

397
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,243
Why don't you come over here?

398
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:35,080
To my house.

399
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,366
Yes, seriously.

400
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:45,841
Hey.

401
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:54,383
Yo, you sure this is okay?

402
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,101
She's not here.
Nobody's here.

403
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:02,441
All right.
So, uh...

404
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,776
Something's come up.

405
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,061
Mike wanted to come here
to give you the hard sell,

406
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,365
but I figured it'd be better
coming from me.

407
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,669
Mike's connection won't buy
mine and Mike's shares

408
00:29:13,703 --> 00:29:16,588
of the methylamine unless he
gets your share, too.

409
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:20,075
He wants the entire
thousand gallons.

410
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,577
Absolutely not.

411
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,297
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

412
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,466
But I've been thinking
about it,

413
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:31,053
and it really makes sense.

414
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:33,588
- Kinda.
- It does, does it?

415
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:37,426
Look, when you, uh,
when you started this thing,

416
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,928
did you ever dream
of having $5 million?

417
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,097
I know for a fact
that you didn't.

418
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:46,402
I know for a fact all you
needed was was 737,000,

419
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:49,621
'cause you worked it all out,
like, mathematically.

420
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:54,243
Look, if selling the methylamine now
means that no one else ever gets killed,

421
00:29:54,277 --> 00:29:57,112
then I vote for that, man.
Hands down.

422
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,997
And we could have it tomorrow.

423
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:00,666
We would be out.

424
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,134
You could spend time
with your family.

425
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:03,752
No more worrying
about them getting hurt

426
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:05,637
or finding out
about everything.

427
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:07,289
Isn't this what you've
been working for?

428
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,842
I have not been working
this hard just to sell out.

429
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:13,645
It's not selling out.
Yes, it is, Jesse.

430
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,267
I ha-- We have suffered and bled,
literally, for this business.

431
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:21,937
And I will not
throw it away for nothing.

432
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:25,824
I don't know how else
to say it, Mr. White.

433
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:29,445
$5 million isn't nothing.

434
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:35,918
Jesse, have you heard of a
company called "Gray Matter"?

435
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:39,088
- No.
- Well, I co-founded it

436
00:30:39,122 --> 00:30:41,540
in grad school with a couple
of friends of mine.

437
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:44,326
Actually, I was
the one who named it.

438
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:47,045
And back then, it was just--
Oh, it was just small-time.

439
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,465
We had a couple
patents pending.

440
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,000
But nothing earth-shattering.

441
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:55,771
'Course, we all knew
the potential.

442
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:58,557
Yeah. We were gonna take
the world by storm.

443
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,729
And then...

444
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,366
This, uh-- Well, something
happened between the three of us.

445
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,486
And I'm not gonna go
into detail.

446
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,322
But for personal reasons,

447
00:31:13,356 --> 00:31:15,073
I decided to leave the company.

448
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,377
And I sold my share
to my two partners.

449
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:21,413
I took a buyout for $5,000.

450
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:25,717
Now, at the time, that was
a lot of money for me.

451
00:31:27,504 --> 00:31:30,088
Care to guess what that
company is worth now?

452
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,392
Millions?

453
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:37,062
Billions, with a "B."

454
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:40,649
2.16 billion
as of last Friday.

455
00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:43,235
I look it up every week.

456
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,938
And I sold my share,

457
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,407
my potential,

458
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:52,361
for $5,000.

459
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:56,532
I sold my kids' birthright
for a few months' rent.

460
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:59,201
This isn't the same thing.

461
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,673
Jesse, you asked me

462
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:08,760
if I was in the meth business
or the money business.

463
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:11,513
Neither.

464
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:13,915
I'm in the empire business.

465
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:21,223
I don't know.

466
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:26,562
Mr. White, is a meth empire really
something to be that proud of?

467
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:42,911
Skyler, you remember Jesse.

468
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:45,130
Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler.

469
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,965
Hey, Mrs. White.

470
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,634
Good to see you.

471
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:50,752
You have a lovely home.

472
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:53,005
- I was just heading out.
- Why don't you stay for dinner?

473
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:56,975
- No, Mr. White. I'm gonna go.
- Stay.

474
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,178
Come on. It'll be fun.

475
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,314
It's okay with us,
isn't it, Skyler?

476
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:04,466
We don't have anything
special planned tonight.

477
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,972
Yeah.

478
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,858
Sure.

479
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:17,829
Why not?

480
00:33:19,982 --> 00:33:22,451
See?

481
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:43,855
Mm.

482
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:47,175
These are great green beans,
Mrs. White.

483
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:51,363
I like that you got
the slivered almonds going.

484
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:54,483
My mom always
made them like that.

485
00:33:54,517 --> 00:33:56,685
You put lemon in there, too?

486
00:33:56,703 --> 00:34:01,856
They are from the Deli
at Albertson's.

487
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,876
Oh.

488
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:07,996
Oh. Well, uh,

489
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,500
Good-- good work
on your shopping then.

490
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:15,721
Because these are choice.

491
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:33,572
I, uh, I eat a lot
of frozen stuff.

492
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:36,558
It's usually pretty bad.

493
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:39,111
I mean, the pictures are
always so awesome, you know?

494
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:41,730
It's like, "hell yeah,
I'm stoked for this lasagna."

495
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:45,567
And then you nuke it, and the
cheese gets all scabby on top,

496
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,203
and it's like-- it's like
you're eating a scab.

497
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:50,405
I mean, seriously,
what's that about?

498
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:54,743
It's like, yo, whatever happened
to truth in advertising?

499
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:57,579
You know?

500
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,308
Yeah, it's bad.

501
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:16,815
So, hey, uh, how's business?

502
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:18,450
The car wash.

503
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:21,787
Mr. White said it's
going really well.

504
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:24,373
He was, like, you're a--
you're a great manager.

505
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,377
He did, huh?

506
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:31,580
Yeah, he says you've
got it running like a--

507
00:35:31,614 --> 00:35:34,216
Like a machine.
Like, well-oiled.

508
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,885
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

509
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,123
What else did he
tell you about me?

510
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,812
Oh, you know, just...
Just good stuff.

511
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:49,347
Just really, you know,
really good, good stuff.

512
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,149
Um, we don't really
talk that much

513
00:35:51,184 --> 00:35:56,738
about, um, personal--
personal things.

514
00:35:56,773 --> 00:35:59,274
Hmm.

515
00:35:59,308 --> 00:36:03,144
Did you also tell him
about my affair?

516
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:24,332
May I please be excused?

517
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:41,950
You know my kids are gone?
Thank God.

518
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:47,072
No. I don't mean
they're out for the night.

519
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:51,209
They're gone.
They're staying with my in-laws.

520
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:53,795
She made me kick my own kids
out of the house.

521
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:03,171
She told me

522
00:37:03,205 --> 00:37:05,674
that she was counting the days

523
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,542
until my cancer came back.

524
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:14,566
My wife is waiting
for me to die.

525
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:20,238
This business is all
I have left now.

526
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:28,062
It's all I have.

527
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:34,169
And you want to take
it away from me.

528
00:37:55,872 --> 00:38:00,075
I thought you might
try something stupid.

529
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:02,661
- Look, Mike--
- Don't bother, Walter.

530
00:38:02,712 --> 00:38:04,997
Come join me in the office.

531
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,917
I don't think so.

532
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:11,503
That's not a request.

533
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,294
Might as well get comfortable.

534
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:21,480
This deal's going down
tomorrow. It's happening,

535
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:23,098
and there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

536
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:25,817
- Got it?
- Oh, so it's okay for you to steal my--

537
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:28,470
And to ensure that,
you and I are gonna spend

538
00:38:28,488 --> 00:38:31,490
the rest of the night
together in this office.

539
00:38:31,524 --> 00:38:33,992
- Like it's my birthday.
- Mike--

540
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:36,978
When the deal is done, you'll get your money.
I guarantee that.

541
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:41,316
Let me cook it. I'll double
your five and you still walk.

542
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:45,320
You know, I have never seen anybody
work so hard not to get $5 million.

543
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:46,654
Mike, you need to listen to me.

544
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:49,624
No, Walter. The last thing
I need to do

545
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:52,327
is listen to you.
Now, sit down.

546
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:26,545
All right.

547
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:29,364
Walter, I've got
a bit of a quandary here.

548
00:39:29,382 --> 00:39:31,216
I've got something
I need to attend to

549
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,201
before this deal happens.

550
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:37,339
But for some reason, I don't trust
you alone with the methylamine.

551
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:40,008
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

552
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:43,395
You gotta be kidding.

553
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:45,931
Stand up for me, please.

554
00:39:45,982 --> 00:39:49,317
Stand up.

555
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:51,770
Turn around for me.

556
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:53,388
Arms out to the side.

557
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:55,223
Up.

558
00:40:09,756 --> 00:40:11,406
- Oh, man.
- Sit down.

559
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:15,927
Sit down.

560
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:20,549
Give me your wrist.

561
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:29,391
Sorry.

562
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:21,863
All righty. To what
do we owe the pleasure?

563
00:43:21,897 --> 00:43:26,201
Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss
your illegal harassment of my client.

564
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:29,037
This should be good.

565
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:30,772
Mr. Ehrmantraut
has become the subject

566
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,774
of a vicious, relentless,

567
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:37,412
and unwarranted
DEA persecution.

568
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:39,947
Gomie, does that, uh,
that sound right to you?

569
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:42,083
I have no idea what
he's talking about.

570
00:43:42,117 --> 00:43:43,618
Play it as cool
as you like, Fonzie.

571
00:43:43,636 --> 00:43:47,305
But we all know you've been
following my client day and night.

572
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,891
The poor man can't even spend a few
minutes with his granddaughter

573
00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:52,427
without you guys quivering
in the bushes

574
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:54,562
and peeping through
your little binoculars.

575
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:58,299
It's-- Well, it's disturbing.

576
00:43:58,317 --> 00:44:03,738
And it's taken a toll on his
mental and physical well-being.

577
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:06,107
Your client looks fine to me.

578
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:10,662
Well, some hurts only show
on the inside.

579
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:13,815
Now, you guys don't even have
warrants for these tails, do you?

580
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:17,485
Theoretically, these tails
you refer to would be

581
00:44:17,503 --> 00:44:18,953
completely within the bounds
of the law.

582
00:44:18,987 --> 00:44:20,538
We don't need a warrant
to follow somebody

583
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:22,007
through a public place.
Theoretically.

584
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:25,794
Yeah, that is, uh,
theoretically correct.

585
00:44:25,828 --> 00:44:30,048
However, I would counter that an
open-ended, unrestricted surveillance

586
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:33,334
like this amounts to stalking.

587
00:44:33,352 --> 00:44:35,603
Which is illegal.

588
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:38,139
Now, I don't know what it is
you find so interesting

589
00:44:38,173 --> 00:44:40,859
about my client,
and I'm not here to judge.

590
00:44:40,893 --> 00:44:45,280
Different strokes and all.
But sadly, he's just not that into you.

591
00:44:45,314 --> 00:44:48,900
So, I have filed for a
temporary restraining order

592
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:53,154
against the DEA on behalf
of Mr. Ehrmantraut.

593
00:44:55,624 --> 00:44:58,860
Where'd you get
your law degree, Goodman?

594
00:44:58,878 --> 00:45:01,379
The same clown college
you got that suit?

595
00:45:01,414 --> 00:45:02,797
You know who likes this suit?

596
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:06,384
Judge Papadoumian. She thinks
I'm a snappy dresser.

597
00:45:06,419 --> 00:45:08,420
You know what
Judge Papadoumian hates?

598
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:12,891
Police harassment
of a senior citizen.

599
00:45:12,925 --> 00:45:14,809
Sorry.

600
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:16,678
Expect a visit
from the sheriff, agents.

601
00:45:16,712 --> 00:45:19,264
You should have
your <i>ex parte</i> within the hour.

602
00:45:21,233 --> 00:45:22,684
Let's go.

603
00:45:30,943 --> 00:45:32,577
<i>What the hell kind of
judge would issue this thing?</i>

604
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:34,195
<i>Papadoumian, man.</i>

605
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:36,698
<i>She's like Ho Chi Minh.</i>

606
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:38,199
<i>So what we do?</i>

607
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:41,503
<i>Well, not a lot of choice,</i>
<i>you know? We back off.</i>

608
00:45:41,537 --> 00:45:45,373
<i>For the moment. TRO won't stand
up, and Goodman knows it.</i>

609
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:47,041
<i>I don't see what they're</i>
<i>playing at here,</i>

610
00:45:47,075 --> 00:45:49,577
<i>but if Ehrmantraut</i>
<i>wants a fight,</i>

611
00:45:49,612 --> 00:45:52,046
<i>he's gonna get one.</i>

612
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,548
That was a hell of a gamble.

613
00:45:53,582 --> 00:45:54,599
Worked.

614
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:57,719
Yeah, well, not for long.

615
00:45:57,753 --> 00:46:01,189
He's right about that TRO.
It's gonna get tossed toute suite.

616
00:46:01,223 --> 00:46:04,692
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you
just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.

617
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:06,394
So have fun with that.

618
00:46:06,428 --> 00:46:09,280
How much time I got?

619
00:46:09,315 --> 00:46:12,033
Maybe 24 hours.

620
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:13,535
It's enough.

621
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:15,653
It better be.
Whatever you got planned,

622
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:18,373
you best pull the ripcord
while you still have a chance.

623
00:46:32,304 --> 00:46:33,805
- Where is it?
- Mike--

624
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,390
- Mike!
- Get out of my way.

625
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:37,175
You, sit down.

626
00:46:37,226 --> 00:46:38,960
Mike! Mike!
Hold on, okay?

627
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:41,146
- I am gonna count to three.
- Mr. White's got an idea.

628
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,313
- Mike, I'm serious.
- One.

629
00:46:42,348 --> 00:46:43,314
- Two.
